      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5328.html</link>
      <description>All systems suffer from failures, but less frequently than expected. Why is it we have so few accidents in a world that behaves so badly?

      <title>Tomaz Stolfa - Goodbye VoIP Clients. Hello New Browser Technologies. Hello New User Cases.</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5214.html</link>
      <description>What if you didn&amp;#039;t use multiple phone numbers or multiple SIM cards during international travel? What if you didn&amp;#039;t have a phone number at all but a plain-text alias that people could dial into? Just like domain names in the place of IP addresses, what if human beings had unique aliases that could replace phone numbers, and these aliases were not tied to a carrier or a telephony operator? What if collect calls were possible on the Web? What if you could have a disposable phone that you used only for one phone call and never again? Tomaz Stolfa, the founder of Vox.io is working on making this a reality.</description>

      <title>Jeremie Miller - Data Is Not Primary</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5272.html</link>
      <description>In the last decade, social media has changed the way we live our lives. We have all become high producers and consumers of social data. The data we generate is not just data, though. It tells our story. It is biographical. However, access to social data so far has been governed by APIs, and any API with a terms-of-service is restrictive. What if we could provide you a one-stop shop, an unrestricted, seamless, single point of access for all your social data; and you owned it all? Jeremie Miller, jabber/XMPP creator, has &amp;quot;Singly&amp;quot; to provide this.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5210.html</link>
      <description>If the delivery of pizza, flowers and books can be free, why not the delivery of bytes over the Web? Even landline telephone providers have a &amp;quot;1-800&amp;quot; model that delivers signal for zero cost to the carrier and the consumer. Thomas Sachson, founding member of of Box Top Solutions, proposes a market-driven model that can provide free or subsidized bandwidth and still pay for itself.</description>

      <title>Andrew Savikas - Stories from 10 Years of Subscription Usage and Sales at Safari Books</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5185.html</link>
      <description>Once Andrew Savikas took over as CEO of Safari Books, he realized a few things about the online subscription model.  First, he realized Safari Books has had a 100% growth each year for the last ten (10) years.  Second, he witnessed the number of tablets double over Christmas 2011. This meant that customers were becoming accustomed to reading online and using online subscription services.  In this keynote, Andrew suggests that subscription models offer a bona-fide business model for publishers of many genres of books.

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5184.html</link>
      <description>How To Be Black is a book that has shades of gallows humor, racism, satire, autobiography and self-help. But throughout the comical and anecdotal narrative of the book runs a low vein, an undertone that challenges the fallacious social beliefs about racial stereotypes. Its author Baratunde Thurston explains how the book began, what the book is about, why he wrote it, and how it evolved as he was writing and producing it.  In the end it is a fascinating exploration of the future of publishing, today.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5216.html</link>
      <description>According to Michael Luna, better radio technology, such as 4G, is not enough to resolve the current and coming data crisis. The data tsunami challenge has been to keep user experience satisfying, while keeping app signaling and network activity clutter to a minimum. Although web-connected applications are still the bulk of the issue, the weight and complexity of streaming is becoming the next significant annoyance. This will lead to a twelve-fold increase in demand for networked services over the next five years.</description>

      <description>Kirk Skaugen presents Intel&amp;#039;s perspective on the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of internet data for purposes of understanding and optimizing web usage. He does not use this dry definition of web analytics, but instead points out that 245 exabytes of data were sent over the internet in 2010, more than for the entire history of the web. It included forty-hours of YouTube video uploaded per minute, 200 million tweets a day, and 7.5 billion photos uploaded per month. Quality and speed are increasing, and costs are shrinking.</description>

      <title>Michael Calabrese - The Myth of Spectrum Scarcity</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4967.html</link>
      <description>Spectrum, according to Michael Calabrese, is an infinitely renewable resource. However, exclusive use, auctions, and large corporations lead to a massively inefficient use of that spectrum for communication. In this talk, the Vice President and Director of the Wireless Future Program presents how spectrum has been divided, discusses contemporary difficulties, and suggests a few solutions that would lead to opportunistic and efficient usage of air space.

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5111.html</link>
      <description>Google wants to make the Web faster. Arvind Jain and Sreeram Ramachandram from Google unveil Chrome Instant, a new feature built right into Google&amp;#039;s browser Chrome, to make your search results load faster. With Chrome Instant enabled, Google makes an intelligent guess about which search result you are most likely to click on, and pre-loads that search result into a new, hidden tab in Chrome. If you do click on the search result, the hidden tab is unhidden, creating the illusion of an instant browsing experience.</description>

Telecomm systems cannot carry double cream anymore with multiplexing and people need to get over that, says Neil Davies, Co-Founder or Predictable Network Solutions.  Neil describes how to apply rational choices to remove hand waving and risk.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5110.html</link>
      <description>Tim Caswell talks about NodeJS and WebKit. Node is a relatively new and open source software system designed for writing scalable internet applications, mostly for web servers. WebKit is an open source web browser engine with a focus on mobile users. Because of the open source nature and widespread experience with JavaScript these two frameworks allow many developers scattered across the globe to collaborate on projects for which they have a shared interest. They are also more easily learned and applied systems than older competitors.

Here, he discusses the global open internet and its relation to governments and public perception. He emphasizes the importance of open access to information on the internet for innovation and job growth, yet this is offset by growing trust issues.</description>

      <title>Jan Dawson - Telecoms in 2020: a Vision of the Future</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5209.html</link>
      <description>Apple and Google are both big enough to buy AT&amp;amp;T. So, would they want their own carrier? Jan Dawson of Ovum Telecoms makes a ten-year projection for the telecom industry. He predicts two trends. A shift in value from carrier to content. And the needs of telecom consumers driving the development of offers, which in turn will lead to the formation of two types of players -- the S.M.A.R.T. and the L.E.A.N.</description>

      <description>Computer systems are moving from local to distributed form while growing in complexity. One result is an increased concern about system failure. Justin Sheehy believes the concern is misplaced and we should focus more on recovery. All systems eventually fail. A powerful recovery capability will quickly compensate for this. And while highly distributed systems are increasingly complex, they can and are being developed to be fault-tolerant. A fault-tolerant system provides an early warning to allow timely application of a recovery plan. </description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5258.html</link>
      <description>TrialPay is a transaction processing company that wants to make more than a two percent fee from each transaction -- so they do it for free. Alex Rampell explains that the data on any transaction is worth more than 2 pct. Further, he believes the 2 pct charge is going away. So TrialPay is selling ad space around the receipt. Rampell says payment companies can monetize data better than anybody, offering opportunities to advertisers, while keeping customer transactions secure.</description>

      <description>For robotics to become ubiquitous, the key is a simple efficient connector. Organic chemistry is a simple self-reconfiguring process which inspired Tom Larkworthy to emulate it in self-reconfigurable robots. Larkworthy&amp;#039;s pragmatic work focuses on a lattice arrangement, a hexagonal metamorphical robot with a simple set of local motion constraints. Per Sjöborg and Larkworthy discuss how gender, simplicity and limits contribute to efficiency in self-reconfigurable robots.</description>

      <description>When minority students are given subtle attitude-changing strategies to encourage a sense of belonging, their GPA goes up, the achievement gap goes down, and they report better health and well-being. That was the conclusion of a study co-led by Greg Walton and discussed in this university podcast. The results suggest that social belonging is a psychological lever where targeted intervention can have broad consequences that lessen inequalities in achievement and health. Walton spoke at the Stanford Prosocial Briefing.</description>

According to Kate Matsudaira, VP at SEOmoz, balancing interests between what is needed in the short-term and the longer-term can be tricky. Doing a thorough post-mortem analysis of what went wrong and communicating it broadly can go a long way to restoring confidence and to avoid falling into the same trap.</description>

In this audio lecture, sponsored by the Stanford Social Innovation Review, Stanford sociology professor Doug McAdam argues that youth volunteering does not directly result in active citizens or a robust civil society.

      <description>Last year the internet ran out of 32-bit IP addresses. Sharing IP addresses, as in the standard IPv4, has its problems, but who would volunteer to be the first to switch to the 128-bit standard, IPv6? Thus, June 8, 2011 became World IPv6 Day, in which thousands of big sites switched to IPv6, with a dual stack fall-back to IPv4. In this talk, Ian Flint, Architect at Yahoo!, tells the story of how Yahoo geared up and tested for the switch, and what they learned.</description>

      <description>Can you recall what it feels like when an opportunity is exploding, right in front of you?  Like the gold rush in the United States in the 1800&amp;#039;s, big data appears to be peaking right now.  It certainly has gotten a lot of attention lately, but Mark Masden places it in context in this keynote address.  Big data is just another phase of computer science and our use of computers to model, capture, and analyze business processes.  Mark emphasizes that we avoid collecting data without a clear vision for its potential.</description>

      <description>Do you remember hearing about the massive opposition to SOPA and ACTA?  It was a surprising show of unity, and helped temporarily defeat these efforts.  Joe Karaganis has been studying global copyright infringement. In a recent report, Joe explains why &amp;quot;piracy&amp;quot; is too easy to stop.  He also describes a global problem where less developed countries are prohibited from gaining access to information.  In response, he recommends establishing &amp;quot;shadow libraries&amp;quot; to help students everywhere.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5080.html</link>
      <description>In the early years of the Internet, many of the leading companies were startups.  Now they employ thousands of people, but as they&amp;#039;ve grown, they&amp;#039;ve become less risky.  With growing demands to meet expectations, companies must remain innovative. Two common strategies are: (a) buying a startup with innovative products and people; (b) establishing organizational structures that replicate the culture and attitudes of a technology startup. In this panel discussion, executives from AOL discuss their experiences keeping the startup spirit alive.</description>

      <description>Broadband is still relatively cost-prohibitive, and New America Foundation&amp;#039;s Sascha Meinrath has a solution. Rather than having carriers provide all bandwidth for customers, the online market is heading towards a model where apps and data are based on free delivery concepts with pre-loaded bandwidth paid for by the advertiser. Describing the hypothetical and, he says, probably inevitable future of apps, Meinrath discusses the possibilities of content providers paying for select bandwidth in order to ensure large-scale access.

In Eric Ries&amp;#039; mind, publishing has now joined the leagues of music and film, and become a software industry.  In this keynote, Eric shares an analogy where he compares publishing a book to entrepreneurship. Eric describes how he approached the publication of his own book and ends with a lean startup recipe for any content producer.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4962.html</link>
      <description>The number of calling minutes in the world is growing since it was created in 2003, but their shift towards Skype is growing faster. Sten Tamkivi, chief spokesperson for Skype, looks behind this trend, sharing what Skype has learned about simultaneously serving both the most and less developed markets in the world and why this is important. Skype handles one-third of all call minutes, is the only quality video conversation provider with a global footprint and sees increased growth due to video cameras on mobile phones and notebook computers.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5199.html</link>
      <description>The fundamental problem of knowing how to apply knowledge is the focus, as Prof. Subramanian Ramamoorthy studies how agents transfer skills from one situation to another. Ramamoorthy constrains each agent&amp;#039;s environment, limiting interaction to a handful of other agents, so that agents can act with greater autonomy. Host Per Sjöborg enjoys a freewheeling discussion of Ramamoorthy&amp;#039;s career and his groundbreaking work with abstract learning in modular robotic agents.</description>

It should come as no surprise then, that many health experts point to our preference for unhealthy food as a leading cause for the obesity problem in the United States.  Clay Johnson suggests that a similar trend is happening in the way we consume content.  In this keynote, Clay illustrates how our web preferences are impacting the type of content media companies produce and what we can do to combat our information over-consumption.</description>

The mouse and keyboard remain the stalwarts of the productive machine, while computer capacity increases the function of devices large and small.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5129.html</link>
      <description>A primary goal for developers has been to attract eyeballs and create &amp;quot;addictive&amp;quot; experiences. Kelly Goto advises against encouraging addictive behavior in development and innovation. According to Goto human-to-machine communication is presently the standard. As machine-to-human communication and innovation becomes more common, Goto wonders if this will begin a new phase for enhancement of the user experience.</description>

      <description>We are sharing more than ever.  We&amp;#039;re sharing so much that we&amp;#039;re struggling to understand what to do with the data.  We&amp;#039;ve become data rich, but information poor. It is estimated that we&amp;#039;re sharing more than five exabytes of data every two days; roughly the same amount of online data that the world generated until 2003. In this keynote address Hilary Mason introduces some of the challenges of the new age of the exabyte.  She offers what she sees as the opportunity to make the world a better place, by converting data into information. </description>

      <title>Dean Bubley - Is LTE being Held Hostage by Ordinary Voice Telephony?</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4960.html</link>
      <description>Dean Bubley exposes the obstacles and politics surrounding development of the 3GPP LTE effort for optimizing radio access architecture. LTE is being held hostage by the telephony industry and the mobile world is being overlooked, but this must change. Several possible solutions exist, such as IMS voice and Circuit Switch Fallback, but they pose excessive call setup times and compatibility issues. The best resolution is a collaborative effort by carriers and third party VOIP vendors to produce a test vehicle.  </description>

      <description>In this fiery speech, Christian Bahls speaks out as a voice of reason against the WhiteIT project. WhiteIT is a German initiative that seeks to reduce child pornography on the Internet. Bahls&amp;#039; warning is to look carefully into objectives and goals of the project. His concern is that the initiative is trying to use child pornography as a cover to implement intrusive technologies. In addition, he suggests that the initiative misses the larger problem of preventing child abuse and exploitation.

Tucker thinks cloud computing is still in the do-it-yourself stage, but just like with PCs, Tucker believes a common architecture will emerge. For Tucker, that architecture is Open Stack, an open source collection of software that provides a set of services for cloud computing. </description>

Ben Fried, CIO at Google, says it&amp;#039;s time for the rearguard of IT to step up the pace. Cloud computing and personal technologies are pulling at enterprise IT from both ends. Security remains the most critical issue for IT. But the opportunities are better than ever if IT can adapt. </description>

      <title>Ariel Waldman - Hacking Space Exploration</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail5135.html</link>
      <description>She had no professional background or experience, but was fully inspired when she sent her shot-in-the-dark email to NASA asking to volunteer. Their receptiveness launched Ariel Waldman into her mission to make space exploration more accessible to the public. In this presentation, she explains that engaging the public is not about corny, sci-fi costuming. It&amp;#039;s about removing barriers so inspired people can explore, participate and spread their inspiration.</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;Right now we are in a shooting war between users and the analytics people, except the users aren&amp;#039;t armed.&amp;quot;  Cory Doctorow argues that users and Internet companies are performing a transaction.  A transaction where users give personal information in return for use of products or services.  The transaction right now is lop-sided and unfair.  To balance the transaction, Cory offers some suggestions. </description>

As described by Toby Considine, &amp;quot;plug&amp;#039;ins are used for each new control protocol (BACnet, ModBus, DNP, …) to be exposed in the oX server. This model distinguishes between the low level low voltage protocol used for each system and the information harvesting that one wishes to do in the wide world.&amp;quot; Peter discusses the project and its current status and use.</description>

      <description>Why are researchers in the United States accepting money from the government of China, in exchange for improving their surveillance ability? This is one of many uncomfortable questions Evgeny Morozov submits for consideration. He reminds us that although China may be the elephant in the room among obviously repressive governments, the role played by Western policymakers, corporations, and institutions which trade with them, make excuses for them, and profit from business with them is a more immediate peril to us all.</description>

      <description>What&amp;#039;s the key facial feature of your design? That one element that grabs people on an irrational level, reflects the big concept, and becomes the icon for your product or service. Gretchen Anderson points to BMW cars&amp;#039; split grill, Tivo&amp;#039;s big, bright &amp;quot;pause&amp;quot; button, and the Flip camera&amp;#039;s flip-out USB plug as examples of successful facial features. Yes, strive for usability, but the most usable designs can be boring. Your design needs personality, too!</description>

All in all, Paul Fenwick says, human minds make a lot of mistakes, and we&amp;#039;re all easy to manipulate. Listing a number of studies, experiments, and business plans, Fenwick dives into how the mind works, where the mind goes wrong, and how businesses can influence people into buying their products.</description>

      <description>The disruption of innovation has yielded as many opportunities for those prepared to take advantage as it has brought disruption for those unprepared to adjust.

      <description>Many young professionals apply for positions based on what they studied without much experience actually working in the real world. Instead of considering themselves to be experts in many areas, Theo Schlossnagle of OnmiIT argues that professionals &amp;quot;must treat what you do as a craft&amp;quot;. He discusses how his experience with both software development as well as running a company gives him a unique view on how tech professionals can be successful in a career.</description>

      <description>With a good deal of sarcasm, Josh Berkus presents a sardonic critique about scaling tools that are trendy rather than reliable. Josh Berkus, CEO of PostgreSQL, gives a facetious list of do&amp;#039;s and don&amp;#039;ts for database creation and application design that, while often popular today, are not stable techniques. In the same cynical tone of this short presentation, Berkus sarcastically places sexiness at the top of the list of qualities to maintain when scaling website elements.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4908.html</link>
      <description>Jim Fruchterman of Bookshare believes accessible books can become a profit center for publishers, while still protecting copyright. Formerly, preparing accessible books required an extra step. Now, accessibility can be generated as a by-product of book production. Bookshare has been serving the one percent of individuals qualified through federal funding for free access for the print disabled. But there is an untapped market of others who would willingly buy accessible materials. </description>

Some within Sun Microsystems, which bought MySQL, were offended but later that day, Aker&amp;#039;s upgrades were publicly praised by Sun Micro senior brass. Aker talks past, present, and future importance of Drizzle and open source, to the database environs commonly called the cloud.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4918.html</link>
      <description>Agilent&amp;#039;s lead technologist offers predictions for 3GPP LTE cellular technology. LTE (Long Term Evolution) is not a done deal, he explains, because its performance advantage is not yet proven. It has to be economically viable. The future of wireless is bright, but it has to be based on low-cost, low complexity technology. In the end, Rumney says, watch out for WiFi, because it is delivering where cellular isn&amp;#039;t.</description>

      <title>Brian O&#039;Leary - Context First: A Unified Field Theory of Publishing</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4905.html</link>
      <description>Books aren&amp;#039;t just books anymore. Books are multi-dimensional, and increasingly, not even in traditional book format. Different types of media are escaping their usual containers, and it is context, rather than just content, that is beginning to drive successful publishing. Brian O&amp;#039;Leary discusses the damage caused by a continued reliance on the &amp;#039;container model,&amp;#039; in light of how much the Internet is changing all content. He also shares how to effectively use context. </description>

      <description>In the future consumers may have lower costs for services they demand but at the cost of their privacy and attention, while private enterprise will benefit from a wide variety of customers and more expansive relationships with those customers. Martin Geddes imagines the public will soon be ready to receive billing and customer service notices via pay-per-moment options added to Twitter or other social media instead of through today&amp;#039;s minute-based telephony.

      <description>Victor Kuo talks about how he has developed radio communication that can handle many transmitters sending at the same time. He has focused on the crosstalk problem, which was a major obstacle to using radios for module to module communication. Parallel wireless radio communication architecture will be a very powerful tool because it can handle the communication in a range of distances from global communication to near distance. This method can also could be used to communicate when the modules are connected.</description>

      <description>The global television system is a half-trillion dollar business, leading Peter Chernin to say the cable business is &amp;quot;one of the great business models of all time.&amp;quot; It is not surprising then that traditional television companies are nervous about new technologies, such as Netflix and Google TV, looking to secure content rights. Television companies must sharpen their game to maintain their 50 to 90 percent profit margins in the forthcoming digital age.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4893.html</link>
      <description>Rotating, rolling, turning, moving forward and moving backward are all impressive gates for modular snake robots, but Per Sjoborg says the striking side-winding motion can only be described as beautiful. These complex patterns of locomotion emerge from simple fluctuations in oscillation. Beyond aesthetics and practical applications, one of the most striking features of Juan Gonzalez Gomez&amp;#039;s work is his commitment to the free and open-source development model. He believes that the modular robotic community will emerge to solve problems together. </description>

      <description>Web forms suck, but they can be delightful, if designers will adopt a new mindset and use the latest tools. Luke Wroblewski has studied rich interactions in Javascript to find the best improvements over plain old web forms. He suggests novel ways to use data collected where people already live, in email, IM, and web services, so no forms are needed. And he delights in new kinds of interaction possible on mobile devices, with their sensors, soft keyboards, and advanced displays. Today, web forms can be wonderful.</description>

      <description>With several mobile device platforms in wide use, the designer&amp;#039;s job is more complex than ever. Suzanne Ginsburg sorts it all out, proposing several approaches and giving examples and tradeoffs of each. Should you design a native app only for the iPhone? A web app that works on Android and Windows phones, too? Or should your design fall somewhere between, targeting only a few platforms? Or take a hybrid approach? Suzanne gives guidelines to help you decide and describes tools that can ease the designer&amp;#039;s task.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4974.html</link>
      <description>Maps tell stories: track Japan after the tsunami or the Gulf oil spill through time. Jack Dangermond, the president of Esri, talks about and demonstrates ArcGIS.com&amp;#039;s new cloud-based GIS computing and intelligent web maps. These two innovations are allowing end users to create their own maps using GIS software online with any device. The Esri cloud will store and share map creations online in real-time, integrating geospatial science and technology into our everyday lives.</description>

      <link>http://chi.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4749.html</link>
      <description>With each new social network, it seems social media becomes more important. With a lot of competition for our attention, effective user experience is critical. Erin Malone says we must focus on how people first interact with our designs, then carefully help them flow from one stage of participation to the next. Erin describes clear patterns that help social services ease people on board and encourage them to interact with others.</description>

      <description>Our &amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; world is also hyper-local. Location is becoming simultaneously more and less relevant. Julia Grace discusses why we buy some things from across the globe and others at our corner shop.  Could our experience at the stores could be improved by using all the data that we generate every day paying with credit cards, checking in at Foursquare or using customer-linked cards? Could super-computers be used to sort through all the data we are generating and personalize our shopping experiences? This is an ethnographic look at shoppers today.</description>

      <description>A flash at 3 AM inspired Wei-Min Shen and Peter Will to use life-like hormones to control robot transformations. Years later, Wei-Min Shen is still learning new advantages of such a novel life-science approach to robotic control. In this interview, Per Sjoborg asks Wei-Min Shen how he defines three-degrees of freedom for his reconfigurable robots, how far Shen&amp;#039;s blue-sky dreams reach and how to achieve his practical goals. In this fun exchange, Sjoborg explores the nitty-gritty problems of keeping robots clean, dry and safe before aiming for loftier goals. </description>

      <description>Author Margaret Atwood, creator of fictional dystopias, speaks on the plight of the author in the face of changes to the publishing industry today. She takes it down to first principles, in a partly historic, partly autobiographical way, how the &amp;quot;publishing pie&amp;quot; is divided.

      <description>The future is not just in social media&amp;#039;s connection to people but in &amp;quot;discovery:&amp;quot; the virtual exploration of physical spaces. This is what Dennis Crowley, founder of Foursquare, believes is the future of location applications. The check-in provides more than just the ability to see &amp;quot;who&amp;quot; is around but to see &amp;quot;what&amp;quot; is around. Dennis believes the combination of rewards, badges, tips and discovery are what make Foursquare successful.</description>

Solove writes in his new book Nothing to Hide: The False Tradeoff Between Privacy and Security, many people say, &amp;quot;If you&amp;#039;ve got nothing to hide, you shouldn&amp;#039;t worry about government surveillance.&amp;quot; However, Solove argues that it should not be necessary to choose security over privacy. He discusses the history of privacy law and reviews the problems of technology and privacy.</description>

      <title>Ismail Elshareef - Mitigating Advertising Impact on Page Performance</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4623.html</link>
      <description>At Edmonds, the car-shopping site, &amp;quot;ads are our bread and butter,&amp;quot; says Ismail Elshareef, Director of Front-end Engineering. But they needed more speed. Elshareef set a goal to have load events firing in 1.5 seconds, while maintaining the same number of ad impressions and ad events on the page. The Edmonds team worked through multiple solutions for minimizing the load latency of ads, and optimized an ad loader they plan to share as open source.</description>

      <description>After the earthquake in Haiti, a community of crisis mappers immediately began crowdsourcing open street maps in a way that has changed disaster response forever.  Using an open source stack and simple collaboration tools to annotate image sets, usable maps were quickly put in the hands of rescue workers, allowing an unprecedented rapid response that saved lives.  Many lessons, technical and operational, are shared on how to build and sustain momentum for rapid, meaningful data sharing that can dramatically impact relief efforts.</description>

      <description>Are you experiencing slow load times on ad-supported pages? The optimization of display ad content is pretty well worked out, so frustrating delays are more likely to be the result of numerous HTTP requests related to two things: the complicated real-time ad-serving market and the tracking attached to ads in a market where advertisers are anxious to know ad effectiveness. But if viewers give up on waiting, that&amp;#039;s all moot. Tony Ralph of Yahoo Ad Operations analyzes ads, identifies points of delay, and suggests standards.</description>

      <description>Do we know how to design successful social environments? Is &amp;quot;social experience design&amp;quot; understood as well as &amp;quot;visual design&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;interaction design&amp;quot;? Not yet, says Xianhang Zhang. He believes social design is still in its pre-scientific era: inefficient, error-prone, and unpredictable. Hang calls for a formal theory of social experience design and describes his own theoretical framework. As a first exercise of his principles, he is creating a Design Guild as a way to foster better designers.</description>

      <description>Careful study of Amazon.com reveals design treasures of surprising value. Jared Spool has studied Amazon for years and developed insights into which design elements create more sales, and why. But he cautions designers not to copy Amazon blindly. Some features only work for the dominant on-line retailer. Some don&amp;#039;t even work for Amazon, whose site is peppered with &amp;quot;dead soldiers,&amp;quot; the remnants of abandoned experiments. Along the way, Jared points out funny effects of Amazon&amp;#039;s automation at scale. Even those show Amazon has much teach us.</description>

      <title>Osama Bedier - Inflection Point: Mobility Transforms E-Commerce</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4836.html</link>
      <description>Commerce enters a new phase which brings back &amp;quot;local and personal&amp;quot;, Google&amp;#039;s Osama Bedier explains.  But the innovation won&amp;#039;t come without its challenges.  These trends require payments to become completely digital, inventories to move to the cloud and platforms that determine user identity to become interoperable. After hurdling these barriers, technology can bring commerce back to the intimacy of 50 years ago. Sellers hope to see the return of traditional consumer loyalty as well.</description>

      <description>Deborah Estrin talks about GIS tracing of individual activity, it&amp;#039;s fascinating usefulness, and potential privacy drawbacks. She assesses how combining tools such as location trace and environmental data with a wellness focus can inform public policy and personal decision making. According to Estrin experience sampling can yield data points which help patients to adjust and cope with medications. On the other hand, these living records can be intimate traces almost impossible to erase.</description>

      <description>Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon speeding down the motorway, filled with magnetic tapes full of data. Those tapes hold a large amount of data, but the station wagon is hardly traveling at the speed of light; and adding more station wagons isn&amp;#039;t going to make them go any faster. This quick talk by Philip Tellis describes how to measure latency and what to do about it.</description>

Carbon pricing, says Harvard professor Robert Stavins. Speaking at the 2010 Climate Policy Instruments in the Real World conference at Stanford University, Stavins explains how two instruments, carbon fees (taxes) and cap and trade, can be used to promote environmental responsibility, even though these mechanisms may be imperfect.</description>

      <description>If you remember programming in C, you&amp;#039;ll remember that it felt like music, or wine, or philosophy. Programming languages back then were laconic; they said all in just a few words. Today&amp;#039;s mainstream programming languages, in contrast, are heavy, intricate and verbose. How did we get here and what comes next? Rob Pike, the co-creator of the Go programming language and a Distinguished Engineer at Google, thinks the solution is a language that gives us the best from both worlds.</description>

      <title>John Kehoe - Social Entrepreneurship and Cocoa Farmers</title>
      <link>http://sic.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4518.html</link>
      <description>Fair trade is not enough in sourcing high-quality organic cocoa beans. Social entrepreneurship must be driven by a greater interest in working with farmers directly, helping them produce more tasty crops and, in the process, improve their standard of living. So says chocolate factory executive John Kehoe in this audio lecture sponsored by the Stanford Center for Social Innovation. Kehoe discusses how his company works to cultivate not only crops, but also relationships in developing countries. </description>

      <description>Jef Raskin started Apple&amp;#039;s Macintosh project, and he wants to set the record straight. He decries mistakes in published accounts of the creation of the Macintosh. For example, he cites the &amp;quot;creation myth&amp;quot; that the Mac was built by &amp;quot;college drop-outs and intuitive engineers flying by the seats of their pants.&amp;quot; Jef spices his account with anecdotes of square pixels, one-button mice, bit-mapped fonts, and more. A longtime BayCHI member, Jeff passed away a year after this program, the last of his six BayCHI appearances since 1994.</description>

      <title>Frances Pinter - Rethinking The Role and Funding of Academic Book Publishing</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4754.html</link>
      <description>Contrary to digital media, monographs are becoming financially nonviable to produce and maintain. Frances Pinter, Publisher at Bloomsbury Academic, argues that the only way to rescue monographs is to publish them under a Creative Commons license, provide open access, and charge customers for print-on-demand services. Will this be a sustainable business model? Pinter takes a critical position on several alternative strategies and plays devil&amp;#039;s advocate on her own proposal.</description>

      <link>http://chi.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4400.html</link>
      <description>No product is an island. People switch freely between desktop apps and web sites, so studying your product in isolation can&amp;#039;t reveal the true pattern of your customer&amp;#039;s behavior. Cameron Turner describes several kinds of user studies and the kinds of insight each can offer. It&amp;#039;s now possible to capture every click and every change of context, so smart filtering and sampling are important. Studies must comply with privacy laws, a particular challenge with subjects in many countries. But the benefit of new analytics tools are worth the effort.</description>

In our daily use of computers we form goals, make plans to achieve them, and evaluate our progress, all in a fraction of a second. We consciously experience very little of this of decision-making. Jeff uses vivid examples to explain the perceptual constraints that good designers must keep in mind.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4607.html</link>
      <description>Digital topographic maps are just one example of the new geospatial information accessible to you (and your software via API&amp;#039;s). Mark L. DeMulder reports on The National Map of the United States, a collaborative effort to deliver downloadable data and maps, products and services. The geographic information includes &amp;quot;orthoimagery (aerial photographs), elevation, geographic names, hydrography, boundaries, transportation, structures, and land cover.&amp;quot; Other types of information can be superimposed to create new types of maps.</description>

      <description>GreaseMonkey is a powerful tool for customizing web pages after they are rendered in a browser.  Kent Brewster of Netflix demonstrates how you can delete elements from a page, splice in data from another source, or change the way parts of a page are displayed.  Designers can use this to make working prototypes before they go to the engineers that need to implement the changes for real.</description>

      <description>Why did that visitor come to your site? The answer will always surprise you. Avinash Kaushik explains that the &amp;quot;Highest Paid Person&amp;#039;s Opinion&amp;quot; (HIPPO) often overrides expert analysis. He argues that qualitative and quantitative research, traditionally separate, are far more effective when combined, as unified web analytics reveal what&amp;#039;s important to the individual user. He suggests we stay in perpetual beta, because nothing on the web is ever really final.</description>

But many of our most difficult problems in the workplace are cultural, so truly effective solutions require changing the way we think.

      <description>How likely are people to say &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; to a request? We grossly underestimate how helpful people will be. We&amp;#039;re also poor predictors of how many people will ask us for help. In this Stanford Center for Social Innovation audio lecture, Francis Flynn explores why we are consistently bad at predicting cooperative behavior. He offers his counter-intuitive results from laboratory and fund-raising situations. Does it matter if you are reasonable? How much will it affect success if you first ask: &amp;quot;Will you do me a favor?&amp;quot; </description>

      <title>Derek Sivers - Coming Back to Rails</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4565.html</link>
      <description>Musician and CD Baby founder Derek Sivers had already built his popular music selling website using his own cobbled-together PHP framework when he realized he needed to do something different. His quirky code was not able to scale as the site grew and Rails was the solution. In his 2010 Railsconf keynote, Sivers describes the journey he took and his own thought processes in deciding to use Rails as a framework for this award-winning project. </description>

      <description>How do you view a nonprofit? A for-profit? A dot-org? Or a dot-com?  Judgments of warmth and competence drive consumer behaviors such as the likeliness to visit a website or willingness to buy a product from an organization. Understanding consumer stereotypes plays a significant role in how nonprofits and corporations do business. In this Stanford Center for Social Innovation sponsored audio lecture, marketing professor Jennifer Aaker examines the implications stereotypes have on firms.</description>

      <description>Data transparency is not enough; danah boyd powerfully argues that the character of data depends on its interpretation and states her case for data literacy. If people are ignorant about how data is generated, selected and interpreted, power accrues to those who can &amp;#039;spin&amp;#039; the data to support their opinions and biases. Using the example of publicly available sex offender data, released under Megan&amp;#039;s Law, boyd shows that understanding the complexity of data is just as important as making it transparent.

      <description>A subtle reminder of how money can change one&amp;#039;s motivations to be less prosocial and less connected. Experimental research shows that subjects exposed to the concept of money work longer before asking for help, are less helpful to others, create greater physical distance from others, and prefer to play and work alone. In this audio lecture sponsored by Stanford&amp;#039;s Center for Social Innovation, marketing professor Kathleen Vohs demonstrates how small reminders of money can have large-scale influence.</description>

      <title>Christian Crumlish - Designing Social Interfaces: 5 Principles, 5 Practices, 5 Anti-Patterns</title>
      <link>http://chi.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4459.html</link>
      <description>As we use social tools on the web, design patterns are emerging. Social design must be organic, not static, emotional, not data-driven. A social experience builds on relationships, not transactions. In 2008, Yahoo!&amp;#039;s Christian Crumlish introduced the idea of social design patterns to BayCHI. In this 2010 program, he shares what he has learned, including principles of social design: Pave the cow paths. Talk like a person. Be open. Learn from games. And respect the ethical dimension.</description>

      <description>William Patry has been working with copyright law for 25 years and has a number of observations on this continuously evolving challenge. He says we lose respect for the legal system when we use it to solve business problems. Exploring regulatory capitalism as a tool to shield and protect incumbents and the status quo from competition, he says copyright law doesn&amp;#039;t create economic value. Paley sees instead a big need for managerial imagination.</description>

      <description>Listen to enough Baroque harpsichord music, and you&amp;#039;ll decide you&amp;#039;ve heard enough! So says Elaine Wherry, and she applies that lesson to her web designs. Baroque composers used ornament and layering to overcome simple melodies and limited instruments like the harpsichord, but the effect can be grating. As musical technology progressed, composers created more refined works. Elaine draws a parallel with web design and suggests the history of classical music can be our guide toward more subtle designs.</description>

Andreas Constantinou talks about the relative openness of the &amp;quot;eight centers of gravity&amp;quot; in the mobile industry, and says it&amp;#039;s not the licensing, which concerns source control, but the governance, which concerns the product, that developers must watch out for. He explains the mobile phone industry shift and loosely outlines the governance structures of the LiMo, Symbian, and Android foundations.</description>

      <description>What if you could type with your eyes? People with limited mobility may have no other choice. But it&amp;#039;s slow, currently around 12-18 words per minute. Is that the best we can offer? Scott MacKenzie describes the physiology of the eye and technical limits on eye tracking, his work to evaluate various input methods, and his new approach, the &amp;quot;scanning ambiguous keyboard,&amp;quot; that helps some disabled people communicate more freely than ever before.</description>

      <description>People are born learners, but our instinct to strive, learn, and grow can be quickly derailed by the kind of praise we receive early in life. Those praised for being &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; learn that intelligence is a fixed, innate, effortless gift, and they often fail to reach their full potential. Others learn early that effort is the key to life-long learning and go on to exceed our expectations. Those are the findings of social psychologist Carol Dweck&amp;#039;s extensive research into the &amp;quot;Fixed Mindset&amp;quot; vs. the &amp;quot;Growth Mindset.&amp;quot;</description>

      <description>Do great ideas just pop into the heads of lucky geniuses? Getting ideas on a reliable basis is important in a business culture. Brainstorming, although 80 years in existence, is still not well understood. Gayle Curtis explains the rules of brainstorming, or structured ideation, and how proper brainstorming not only promotes ideas, but also promotes a culture of respect, acceptance of points-of-view, and an attitude that continues to foster better ideas.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4297.html</link>
      <description>Michael Calabrese argues that the FCC&amp;#039;s apportioning of the airwave spectrum gives a false impression of scarcity. The government&amp;#039;s spectrum apportioning doesn&amp;#039;t take into account the capabilities and accuracy of today&amp;#039;s digital radio equipment, carving unnecessarily wide detours around both federal and commercial properties, and ignoring low-power opportunities. The recent DTV shift freed 18 channels, netting $2B at auction. More can be done to optimize spectrum use.</description>

      <title>David Fetherstonhaugh - Design Implications of Behavioral Economics</title>
      <link>http://chi.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4279.html</link>
      <description>For every design decision, a host of factors guide the outcome and subsequent user behavior. Often the factors are not rational or reasonable, but rather based on emotion. Behavioral economists are learning what designers already know instinctively: These emotions can be leveraged in the decision-making moment to achieve a desired behavioral end. David Fetherstonhaugh tells us how designers are using behavioral economics, and why it is successful.</description>

      <description>Everyone uses Linux: if they use Google, trade on-line, or use ATMs. Linux is the most ubiquitous OS in everything from cell phones to TVs, precisely because, Jim Zemlin of the Linux Foundation argues, it is free. As convergence between connectivity and device happens, network carriers and device-makers scramble to control a new service-based distribution. Zemlin urges continued protection and support of open-source through the filing of &amp;#039;defensive publications&amp;#039; with the USPTO, and participation in several open-source projects.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4294.html</link>
      <description>At the 2009 eComm, Mark Rolston, Chief Creative Officer of Frog Design, talks about a new phase in design exemplified by the likes of Wii and the Android open OS. We currently live in two worlds, the real and the virtual, mediated by &amp;#039;white boxes&amp;#039; less and less limited by functional distinction. Rolston ponders what we want to do next, what we&amp;#039;ll be able to do next, and how the interface device, if there is one, will look and feel.</description>

      <title>Simon Wardley - Cloud Computing: Why IT Matters</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4353.html</link>
      <description>Although the definition of cloud computing can seem somewhat cloudy, it&amp;#039;s a good thing to understand for business. Canonical&amp;#039;s Simon Wardley argues with humor that &amp;quot;the cloud&amp;quot; represents a natural marketing-cycle progression for IT; from innovation, to product, to service utility. Given the constant pressure toward commoditization, business must keep up, and consider offering cloud services. He introduces Eucalyptus, a tool to build, experiment, and test-deploy virtual enterprise cloud computing.</description>

At somewhere on the order of tens of millions of dollars per project, the majority of this money goes to few select software vendors. It would be nice, though, if some of it were to come to the open source community. Clay Johnson of Sunlight Labs tells us what we can do as open source developers to grab a piece of the action.</description>

      <title>Tim O&#039;Reilly - The War for the Web</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4317.html</link>
      <description>Is the web entering a dark time of struggle and strife?  Tim O&amp;#039;Reilly reflects on the astonishing power of the early internet as an open platform, and worries that escalating competition between large companies may drive it towards a battle ground of locked down services and proprietary data. This atmosphere of &amp;quot;mutually assured destruction&amp;quot; is not inevitable.  Tim thinks web 2.0 companies will ultimately succeed if they stick to their core strengths, stay open, and embrace the &amp;quot;small pieces loosely joined&amp;quot; philosophy.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4274.html</link>
      <description>According to science fiction author Karl Schroeder, it is sometimes possible to get things done more efficiently by relinquishing the traditional methods of control. Open source, democracy, government 2.0, and the invisible hand of the free market are mechanisms that demonstrate of the success of this phenomenon of handing control to a self-willed entity. He calls this principle &amp;quot;rewilding&amp;quot;, and tells how this metaphor relates to open source software and other contemporary technological trends.</description>

      <title>Perry Evans - Will the Promise of Location Based Ad Models Ever Get Off the Ground?</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4182.html</link>
      <description>Perry Evans, CEO of Local Matters, discusses the differences between the daydream of LBS advertising and the reality in this Where 2.0 presentation. If &amp;#039;more precision is better&amp;#039;, then highly targeted geographic advertising that location based services (LBS) and applications allow should mean greater returns for small businesses and application developers. Yet very few local advertising ecosystems have emerged, and Evans, with over 10 years experience in developing LBS applications, knows a lot about why.</description>

But Daniel Debow tells host Jon Udell that when used appropriately it can be a key enabler of interpersonal feedback.</description>

Today, there are 85,000 developers that code against the eBay developer API and make money; some of them make lots of it. Last year alone, the sellers on eBay sold $60 billion worth of goods worldwide, and developers who provided real value to these sellers made a cut.</description>

      <link>http://sic.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3865.html</link>

In this panel discussion, sponsored by the Stanford Center for Social Innovation, experts in the field consider whether such online spaces are simply useful adjuncts to the work of philanthropy--or whether they promise to revolutionize the sector altogether.

      <description>There are many ways to go about consulting, but how do you do it, and how do you do it successfully? Engineer and consultant John Carter says most consulting companies fail because they can not attract the clients who need their services. Failed strategies include calling on their former associates, attending networking events, and cold calling, and waiting for the phone to ring. The key to successful consulting is marketing, not selling.</description>

      <description>Online giving marketplaces allow for the transfer of funds from interested donors and lenders to those who need them.

In this panel discussion, sponsored by the Stanford Center for Social Innovation, philanthropy experts working at online marketplaces discuss how their organizations function and what differentiates them from others.  </description>

This constant attention to making money feeds the Washington &amp;#039;economy of influence&amp;#039;. The morally destitute behavior, foretold by Thomas Jefferson in The Founders&amp;#039; Constitution, undermines the trust of the electorate in the institution of the government.</description>

In this audio interview with host Sheela Sethuraman, Randy Wang describes his motivation to create Digital StudyHall, a collection of mundane technologies that have dramatically improved long distance education. He also talks about his progress and goals.</description>

      <title>David Heinemeier Hansson - Legacy Software</title>

      <description>Legacy software is usually seen as a burden, but in this talk from RailsConf Europe, David Heinemeier Hansson flips that idea on its head. In order to recognize bad software, you have to become a better developer, so if your old code is &amp;quot;legacy&amp;quot;, that means you have progressed. Legacy should be a badge of honor. After discussing the concept of legacy code in general terms, Heinemeier Hansson does some detailed analysis of his own old Rails code.</description>

      <description>At some point while trying to get companies to adopt open source practices, Robert Lefkowitz realized that there was no specific open source software development methodology. In this presentation Lefkowitz discusses how he used Quintilian&amp;#039;s Institutes of Oratory as a starting point to establish a framework for software development. With humor and insight, he outlines issues specific to open source, and shows how companies can create exceptional software by embracing a process where errors are not a bad thing.</description>

      <description>Businesses are not the only organizations rocked by financial scandals. Nonprofits such as the Red Cross, United Way, and many others have been hit as well. In this Stanford Social Innovation Review sponsored audio lecture, Deborah Rhode discusses the need for an ethics upgrade in the nonprofit sector, which by its do-good nature is expected to take the moral high ground. She considers typical pitfalls that nonprofits are vulnerable to, and calls for clearer rules governing transparency and accountability.</description>

In this audio lecture recorded at the Encore Career Summit, sponsored by the Center for Social Innovation at Stanford, Joseph reflects on what it takes to be a great leader in the second half of life.

Simonie, an expert in the field, would like us to believe something else; that the majority of the systems in use today are merely patchworks; that there are, in fact, much better technologies just waiting to be put to use to provide people with satisfactory interfaces.</description>

      <description>Sara Nelson of Publishers Weekly takes a closer look at some of the things you think you know about the book business.

Topics range from what kinds of books we read, how the book industry advertise its products, the issue of piracy in today&amp;#039;s electronic society, and why we are a long way from doing away with books completely.</description>

      <title>Robert Searle - Can Nonprofits Get More Bang for the Buck?</title>
      <link>http://sic.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3846.html</link>
      <description>If you haven&amp;#039;t bought a flat-screen TV yet, chances are you&amp;#039;re waiting for the prices to drop. Technologies get cheaper by virtue of the &amp;quot;experience curve,&amp;quot; a phenomenon where, as companies get better at what they do, costs become lower. In this Stanford Social Innovation Review sponsored audio lecture, Robert Searle argues that nonprofits also can have experience curves, achieving a greater volume of outcomes for the same cost. He discusses the types of outcome metrics on which nonprofits should focus.</description>

      <description>Mark Baker has always worked with distributed systems, starting with DCE and CORBA. When he learned about the Web&amp;#039;s REST architectural style, he embraced it as a better way. When the Web Services movement veered away from key RESTful principles -- a uniform interface, hyperlinked representations -- he campaigned vigorously for them. Now, he tells host Jon Udell, REST has won the web, although not yet the enterprise. </description>

He takes a hard look at how innovations such as hybrid cars and fuel cell buses may, in fact, be exacerbating our problems, and offers concrete, iconoclastic suggestions as to what science, business, and government should be focusing on instead.</description>

      <description>America&amp;#039;s primary and secondary education lags behind that of other advanced countries. In this panel discussion, hosted by the New Republic, experts argue that improving the quality of education would generate enough economic growth to pay for the entire education system itself.

      <description>Mark Jacobstein discusses a solution that brings together VoIP and mobile like peanut butter and chocolate. Mobile voice does not mean running VoIP over the cellular data channel. Instead Jacobstein reveals how the iSkoot solution uses the voice-optimized, circuit-switched network for delivery of voice communication to a mobile device, bringing IP telephony to mobile. He describes the huge success of the &amp;quot;3 Skypephone&amp;quot;, powered by iSkoot, in a handful of countries so far.</description>

A quick (unaudited) look at the books says we&amp;#039;ve distributed $25,484 to the team over the past twelve months and that member dues and donations accounted for $17,880 or roughly 70% of our staff costs. So thanks to our paid members, too. Most of all, have a happy holiday season and a great 2009.</description>

Cheap and ubiquitous location technologies combined with robotic toys have given birth to a thriving amateur Unmanned Aerial Vehicles community.  Though these sophisticated spy toys, which are powered by open source software, are usually flying just for the fun of it, the federal regulators are trying to figure out what is even legal, in this brave new little world.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#039;ve become so used to the idea of telecom as a service in the style of the railroads that we don&amp;#039;t realize that we don&amp;#039;t need depend on service providers to assure that we can communicate. It&amp;#039;s just the opposite - the Internet has demonstrated that it&amp;#039;s hard to prevent connectivity.  In this talk from the Emerging Communications Conference, Bob Frankston discusses the potential of the open internet.</description>

      <title>Good Measures Conference - Evaluation for Learning</title>
      <link>http://sic.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3689.html</link>
      <description>Nonprofits tend to collect a great deal of evaluative data but often have no idea how to use it to assess their performance--particularly because doing so properly is a complicated process requiring serious social sciences knowledge. In this panel discussion, part of the Stanford Social Innovation Review&amp;#039;s conference on evaluation, two experts talk about how an organization may better use such data--as well as &amp;quot;external&amp;quot; information in the form of theory and advice--to create a &amp;quot;culture of inquiry&amp;quot; focused on learning and improvement.</description>

      <description>Could Hammurabi have written the laws to prevent the Enron scandal? J. Storrs Hall, scientist and author Of Beyond AI, poses this question to demonstrate the near impossible challenge confronting scientists in the current discussion of machine ethics. The future of AI envisions machines with the capacity to far exceed humans in knowledge and intelligence. It is a far greater problem than the one for which Isaac Asimov originally wrote the Three Laws of Robotics. </description>

      <description>Evaluation is one of the most powerful mechanisms a nonprofit organization can use to unlock its potential, become more effective, and achieve success. But traditional evaluation methods are expensive, require thorough knowledge of the social sciences, and take a good deal of time to perform. In this part of the Stanford Social Innovation Review&amp;#039;s conference on evaluation, Mark Kramer details how nonprofits can better incorporate evaluation to achieve their mission and bring about social change.</description>

In this session from the 2008 O&amp;#039;Reilly Emerging Technology Conference, Eric Rodenbeck, founder and creative director for Stamen Design, offers several examples of how computers, massively large databases, and visualization can be combined to create beautiful, yet scientifically valuable ways of exploring data. </description>

      <description>On February 17, 2009, all analog television broadcasting in the United States will convert to digital.  Millions of households will need to either replace their televisions, sign up for cable or satellite service, or install a digital signal converter.  While the Federal government has subsidized these and assured that the switch will be cheap and easy, a reporter for IEEE Spectrum radio who tries it herself finds that for her, it is neither cheap nor easy.</description>

In this presentation of the O&amp;#039;Reilly Tools For Change conference, Erin McKean, Chief Consulting Editor for American Dictionaries at Oxford University Press, explains the characteristics of books, why the book isn&amp;#039;t a good form for dictionaries to take, and how the information in dictionaries could better be disseminated.</description>

      <description>Other frameworks have cloned features of Rails. But according to its creator, David Heinemeier Hansson, the Rails philosophy of convention over configuration and abstracting the user from making choices, continues to give its developer community a competitive advantage. The only parallel that can compete will have to be something that is significantly better than Rails which, although it is a possibility, doesn&amp;#039;t seem very likely.</description>

      <description>Do you appreciate when someone brings a fresh perspective to a complex and daunting issue? Well can you imagine an issue more impenetrable or discouraging then the Singularity? From the &amp;quot;How Far are We from Advanced AI?&amp;quot; session of the 2007 Singularity Summit, Paul Saffo offers some new advice. He recommends that we find some poets and novelists and whisper in their ears about this stuff. Then hopefully they will help shape what the Singularity should be, rather than what we hope it will not be.</description>

      <description>The economic realities of hardware development often stifle innovation. Peter Semmelhack, CEO of Bug Labs, discusses a change in approach, similar to the open source software model, that will promote innovation in the  hardware space. Based on the Lego model, Bug Labs is creating a set of tools they believe will eliminate some of the cost and creative prohibitions, and enable a community of users and developers to experiment with the creation of new gadgets.

      <description>San Francisco&amp;#039;s young and charismatic mayor, Gavin Newsom, has suffered his share of punches for taking bold positions on controversial issues.

He outlines progressive reforms in areas such as education, health care, and business, and reflects on the personal and professional price paid for supporting one particularly contentious issue: gay marriage.</description>

      <description>At what stage in life do innovators make their most significant contributions to social enterprise? In this audio lecture, economist and creativity researcher David Galenson debunks the myth that high achievement is the domain of youth and genius for an audience of social entrepreneurs over the age of 60. Applying lessons learned from lives of artists and leaders, he considers differences in style and time horizons of creative people, emphasizing that social innovation is more about slow burn than flash in the pan.

      <description>Rick Falkvinge is a Swedish politician who recently founded a new party. Its values include freedom, upholding laws, and rights to privacy. These may sound like safe and just laws - things that are constant and don&amp;#039;t need defending; so what&amp;#039;s jeopardizing them? According to Falkvinge, that would be copyrights and patents.</description>

      <link>http://sic.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3541.html</link>
      <description>In this education podcast, a panel of experts debates the importance of recycling in the effort to achieve environmental sustainability. Those against argue that recycling at the household level doesn&amp;#039;t lead to the perceived benefits, but instead wastes more money and precious time. Those in favor argue that we are nearing a resource crisis that can be mitigated by the re-use of recycled material. Due to brief profanity, this program may not be appropriate for work or family listening.</description>

      <description>We live in a world of cognitive biases and polarized opinions. We consider ourselves to be largely rational, yet we are often prone to systematic errors such as overconfidence, wishful thinking, and the attraction of strong opinions.  This means decisions are often driven more by personalities and passions rather than technical merits.  Economic theorist Robin Hanson explores common errors, and points to innovative tools such as prediction markets which can help overcome bias and promote truth.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3398.html</link>

He argues that singularity-like behavior is already here - as seen in the recent and seemingly accelerating cycles of boom and bust. In this talk from the 2007 Singularity Summit, Thiel discusses this and some unique strategies to manage risk.</description>

      <description>AIDS, malaria, and maternal mortality are some of the chronic public health issues that plague Africa. Invited to Stanford, Paul Farmer talks about how his Boston-based organization, Partners In Health, is spending donor dollars to bring the lessons garnered from its work in Haiti to scale up health care services in war-torn Rwanda. As dicussed in this audio lecture, his organization seeks to fill the gap that exists between medical R&amp;amp;D and health care delivery so preventions and cures can be brought to more of the people who need them.

      <description>On the last day of the Presidential primaries, John McCain spoke to a group of supporters in New Orleans. The speech was widely criticized in the media as illustrating how unfamiliar McCain seemed to be with delivering prepared remarks, even after being a Representative and Senator for 26 years.  Charles Lane, &amp;#039;08 Conversations Host and PRX.org Curator, presents a fascinating comparison between McCain&amp;#039;s awkward comments and Barack Obama&amp;#039;s more natural manner of speaking.</description>

      <description>During past few years we have witnessed a drastic reduction in competition for network services in the US. David Isenberg, author of the essay &amp;quot;The Rise of the Stupid Network&amp;quot;, a paper that shook the telecom world in 1997 and continues to have an impact today, puts the blame squarely on decisions made in Washington DC. This short but pointed talk discusses how this trend is likely to stifle future innovation if it isn&amp;#039;t stopped, and what can be done about it.

      <title>Jules Witcover - The Longest Campaign</title>
      <link>http://08c.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3692.html</link>
      <description>Today, running for the nation&amp;#039;s highest office has become so costly that by the time the November election rolls around total presidential campaign spending will, in all likelihood, easily exceed $1 billion for the first time in history. Jules Witcover is featured in this first part of a series from the Center for Public Integrity. He answers questions for anyone who&amp;#039;s wondered why politicians are allowed to raise and spend money without revealing where their funds are coming from or where they are going.</description>

      <description>Ten years ago, &amp;quot;entrepreneur&amp;quot; didn&amp;#039;t exist in the lexicon of many parts of the world. Now, thanks to the work of a nonprofit called Endeavor, entrepreneurs are emerging in countries where such activity was once impossible. Invited to speak at the Center for Social Innovation at Stanford, Linda Rottenberg shares in this audio lecture how her organization has gone from a &amp;quot;crazy&amp;quot; idea of two business school graduates to an important engine for empowering entrepreneurs in Latin America and beyond.

      <link>http://08c.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3678.html</link>
      <description>Months went by after John Edwards dropped his bid for president. Clinton wooed, Obama wooed. And still the populist kept quiet. For all the anticipation, when Edwards finally endorsed Obama last week in Michigan, he omitted the key phrase: &amp;quot;I endorse&amp;quot;. Only later does Edwards state matter-of-factly that Obama will be the next president. In the end, the Obama campaign never issued a press release using the words endorse nor have all of Edwards&amp;#039; super delegates moved towards Obama.</description>

      <description>Software concurrency is hard to get right, and the main tools programmers have to deal with it are over 30 years old.  Simon Peyton-Jones of Microsoft Research discusses a new technique called Transactional Memory that is simple to program and removes many of the possibilities for error inherent in traditional concurrent programming.  Look for Transactional Memory to be more important as multi-core programming becomes standard.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3365.html</link>
      <description>In this philosophical discussion of principle and policy, Eben Moglen talks about the essence of GPLv3 and argues we&amp;#039;ve wasted the last ten years talking about open source without talking enough about freedom. There&amp;#039;s a lot of work to be done on the distortion of the software market, prevention of monopolies, licensing and patents, and the correction of public policy to prevent the misuse of freedom.</description>

      <title>Jamais Cascio - Metaverse Singularity</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3389.html</link>
      <description>Technology is becoming more entrenched in every part of our life, and we need to be aware of where that might lead us.  Jamais Cascio gives four possible scenarios based on whether technology is used to augment or simulate reality and whether it is internally or externally focused.  Because of the human bias inherent in any technology, he argues that we need to democratically include all of the world&amp;#039;s stakeholders to avoid having these scenarios become dystopias.</description>

      <link>http://sic.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3538.html</link>
      <description>Scientific advances have opened previously unimaginable possibilities in the realm of human reproduction. Determining the sex of an early-stage embryo, or shifting the pre-conception arrangement of chromosomes in favor of certain outcomes, further opens the door to sex selection. By various means, it is becoming feasible to genetically engineer a child with specific qualities. In this audio lecture, Michael J. Sandel and William Haseltine debate the moral and ethical implications of such actions.

      <description>Just as Moore&amp;#039;s law turned personal computers from a curiosity to a powerful tool over the last 20 years, it is now turning cellular phones into mini computers with many of the same capabilities.  Indeed, next year, more smart phones will be sold than personal computers.  Smart phones are a huge, attractive platform for application developers, but how are you supposed to develop software for them?  Alex Russel, creator of the Dojo web toolkit, shares his thoughts from the O&amp;#039;Reilly Emerging Telephony Conference.</description>

      <description>During turbulence and social upheaval most people retreat into themselves and focus on only one task--survival. Fortunately for the women and children of Afghanistan, Sakena Yacoobi did more. With only $20,000, Yacoobi formed what is now the Afghan Institute of Learning (AIL). Until the fall of the Taliban in 2001, AIL operated underground. AIL now serves 350,000 women and children each year. Yacoobi explains her vision for AIL to Design for Change host Sheela Sethuraman as well as her incredible journey and experiences along the way.

      <title>John Kneuer - Broadband Policy</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3361.html</link>
      <description>As high quality spectrum is repurposed after the digital TV transition, what is the best way to ensure fair network access and promote innovation in this valuable new space?  US Department of Commerce technology policy expert John Kneuer argues that market forces, not government regulation, are most likely to produce benefits for network providers, internet application developers and consumers.  Stirring quite a controversy, this substantive talk concludes with a lively discussion of broadband policy and network neutrality.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3401.html</link>
      <description>In the quest for an artificial general intelligence (AGI), researchers should model their approach on human developmental psychology and neurobiology.  Sam Adams of IBM Research led the development of an experimental AGI that would learn based on experience, bootstrap a mental model of itself and its environment, and cull associations that were poor predictors.  He achieved impressive results by basing his architecture on the development of the human mind, the only successful path to human cognition so far.</description>

      <title>Joshua Silver - Bringing Vision to the Masses</title>
      <link>http://sic.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3253.html</link>
      <description>In the United States, at least 60% of the population wears corrective lenses. Worldwide, in contrast, only 5% of the population does. Such statistics have led Josh Silver, Oxford atomic physicist, to conclude that more than half the world needs vision correction but doesn&amp;#039;t have access to it. In this audio lecture, host of the Center for Social Innovation at Stanford, Silver shares how he decided to &amp;quot;do something useful for the world&amp;quot; by creating specialized, liquid-filled corrective lenses that are now worn by some 26,000 people in developing countries.

      <description>Although Java remains one of the world&amp;#039;s most popular development platforms, Ruby and Rails are picking up on a steep upward curve.

      <title>Ed Rowe - Apollo: Rich Internet Applications for the Desktop</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3471.html</link>
      <description>Adobe&amp;#039;s Apollo is a cross-platform runtime that allows a user to run a Web application on his desktop. Isn&amp;#039;t that what a Web browser already does? But Apollo can work offline. You disconnect from the Internet and you are still able to use the Web application. It detects the presence of a network and synchronises your data. If you&amp;#039;re a Web developer, and you want to develop for Apollo, there&amp;#039;s almost nothing new that you need to learn. Ed Rowe of Adobe Systems puts to practice, the wisdom, &amp;quot;Show, don&amp;#039;t tell!&amp;quot; in this demo of Apollo.</description>

      <title>Wendell Wallach - The Road to Singularity</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3404.html</link>
      <description>How close are we to the era where intelligent machines will make decisions for us?  As systems become ever more autonomous, machine decisions may outstrip our ability to predict them, creating the need for an artificial morality.  Yale bioethicist Wendell Wallach takes the role of friendly skeptic in this deeply thoughtful and balanced look at the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, computational ethics and the singularity.

      <link>http://sic.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3475.html</link>
      <description>In Chile, the farming of salmon seemed the ideal solution to the depletion of world fish populations--until it became clear that acquiculture causes its own environmental problems. In an audio interview by Eric Nee, managing editor of the Stanford Social Innovation Review, Rodrigo Pizarro explores the challenges of acquiculture and the foundation&amp;#039;s project to reduce the impact of salmon farming through a sustainable system of seaweed cultivation.

      <description>IBM researchers Fernanda Viegas and Martin Wattenberg are the creators of Many Eyes, a new kind of social website dedicated to data visualization and analysis. Members upload batches of data - about politics, weather, or anything else - then chart, interpret, discuss, and even re-visualize one another&amp;#039;s data. The process is fun, and it also points toward a future in which our collective interpretation of the world is more firmly rooted in data.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3303.html</link>
      <description>From the start, phones have been a point-to-point communication method: pick up the receiver, dial a number, hope for an answer. Jyri Engestrom&amp;#039;s microblogging app, Jaiku, changes all that by interfacing your mobile phone with pervasive internet connectivity. What we get is a handset that is used increasingly less for calling and more for sharing what you&amp;#039;re doing, where you&amp;#039;re going, who you&amp;#039;re with, and the photo you just took. These microposts broadcast a river of rich presence information about you: from one-on-one to many-to-many.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3364.html</link>
      <description>The O&amp;#039;Reilly Media founder and CEO presents one of his regular Radar updates, with the focus this time squarely on open source software. The world in which open source now operates is very different from the world in which it started.  O&amp;#039;Reilly believes that the problems of scaling caused by the growth of the web and large on-line applications means we need to examine the freedoms we associate with open source in a new light. It&amp;#039;s more important than ever that we rediscover the freedoms we care about and learn how to protect them in new and more relevant ways.</description>

      <description>Environmental sustainability is now an imperative for supply chains, and buyers and procurement professionals have more power than ever to exert pressure on suppliers to provide green products. Businesses are also partnering with government and nonprofits to create change in this arena. How do you communicate with suppliers on environmental innovation? At the Stanford 2007 Responsible Supply Chains Conference, executives from an HMO, a government agency, and an entrepreneurial company share successes in greening the supply chains.

      <title>Charles Handy - The New Philanthropists</title>
      <link>http://sic.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3259.html</link>
      <description>In Britain, something is happening that hasn&amp;#039;t for 100 years. More people are becoming incredibly wealthy, not only through inheritance, but also because of their own hard work. A phenomenon on this scale has not happened since the Victorian industrialists. In this audio lecture, Philosopher Charles Handy tells his 2007 Skoll World Forum audience about entrepreneurs who put their energies into meeting some perceived social need--something that government never gets around to and that private enterprise typically doesn&amp;#039;t see a market for.

      <description>Information processing is integrated into everyday objects, and the metaphor &amp;#039;desktop&amp;#039; is obsolete. This post-desktop model of computing is known as &amp;#039;Ubiquitous Computing&amp;#039;, or UbiComp, in the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) jargon. Mike Kuniavsky, the co-founder and Principal of ThingM, a design and research firm, and the author of &amp;#039;Observing the User Experience&amp;#039;, alludes to &amp;#039;magic&amp;#039; as being the new metaphor for ubiquitous computing in his novel perspective.</description>

      <description>In his book, The Long Tail, Chris Anderson, editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine,  states that &amp;quot;our culture and economy is increasingly shifting away from a focus on a relatively small number of &amp;quot;hits&amp;quot; (mainstream products and markets) at the head of the demand curve and toward a huge number of niches in the tail&amp;quot;.  He believes that niche items can now be more successful in the marketplace.  Gerd and Glen discuss this concept, particularly as it relates to future developments.</description>

They talk about how content owners have found ways to quickly filter internet content to assert their copyright rights and share examples about how companies are trying to find ways to be part of the sharing process.</description>

      <link>http://sic.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3280.html</link>
      <description>In this audio lecture, Amory Lovins argues for a sound energy policy that rewards innovation, and for a serious commitment to implementing energy-efficient technological improvements. These combined efforts could subsequently result in saving half of our oil, half of our gas, and three-fourths of our electricity. They would also decrease our dependence on foreign resources and would indirectly alleviate some of the world&amp;#039;s biggest problems.

      <description>Many nonprofits want to expand their staff and funding base so that they may serve a broader public.

In an audio interview with Stanford Social Innovation Review managing editor Eric Nee, William Foster shares findings from the Bridgespan Group&amp;#039;s groundbreaking research on what it takes to be in the big leagues. He discusses types of funders to pursue, how to restructure an expanding organization, and whether going big is right for everyone.

      <link>http://mc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3348.html</link>
      <description>In general terms, Web 2.0 has been described as a more interactive, less passive form of the web. In truth, it is actually the culmination of ideas first proposed during the initial phase of the web. In this episode, Gerd and Glen speculate on what will be the next phase of web development.  They look at how Digital Natives are not aware of a difference between online and offline and how this will help shape the web in the coming years.</description>

      <description>Honeypots have demonstrated immense value in Internet security.  Virtual honeypots share many attributes of traditional honeypots, but you can run thousands of them on a single system-making them easier and cheaper to build, deploy, and maintain.  Thorsten Holz, co-author of the book Virtual Honeypots: From Botnet Tracking to Intrusion Detection, joins Phil and Scott to discuss the book and how the concept can assist in thwarting Internet malware.  He talks about how they can be used for both protection and analysis.</description>

      <description>The internet has come a long way since its inception. You can now talk to a friend in real time while miles away or share photographs with relatives in the next town over. However, there is a method of interaction that we all use infinitely more every single day: voice. While Web 2.0 content is increasing our interaction over the internet, telephony still has yet to hit a big boom. In this talk at the O&amp;#039;Reilly Emerging Telephony Conference, Trevor Baca explains how recent Web 2.0 innovations can be applied to emerging telecom technologies.</description>

      <title>Schuyler Erle - Mapping the Maximum City</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3311.html</link>
      <description>How do you map a city like Mumbai, a huge area with a population of over 14 million people, with a low budget and raw data that consist mainly of hand-drawn maps? Schuyler Erle recounts his experience doing just that. Considerable help came from free software from the geodata community and dedicated enthusiasts collecting control data directly on the streets of Mumbai. Presenting the challenges and rewards that this approach involves, Erle underlines the ultimate goal: letting maps, and the people who are touched by them, tell their stories.</description>

      <description>What are the challenges to traditional copyright caused by technology?  What new rules must be written to protect intellectual property rights, but not overly limit usage in an age where the computer is a copying device and the internet is a giant network of copying devices?  In this episode of Future Talks, Gerd and Glen discuss how technology is leaving old rules behind They also talk about open source and how it relates to possible changes in the current copyright model.

Most significantly, this plan does not rely on big government programs, but leans primarily on the for-profit business sector to lead the way.

      <description>In this conversation with Scott Mace, Centric CRM&amp;#039;s Michael Harvey contrasts Centric CRM from rival SugarCRM, which he says doesn&amp;#039;t scale as well because it&amp;#039;s written in PHP. Harvey then defends Centric CRM&amp;#039;s take on open source: developers who want to build a commercial business on top of Centric CRM must sign a reseller agreement. Harvey also describes &amp;quot;open software-as-a-service&amp;quot; which lets Centric CRM customers easily move their apps from hosted facilities to their own data centers.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1877.html</link>
      <description>Jeff Bonforte was scheduled to talk about the future of VoIP. However, instead of a description of what he calls Telephone 3.0, he delivers an entertaining and typically forthright argument in favor of anger and its power to drive innovation. Bonforte challenges the nerds and dorks of the IT industry to spend less time enjoying problems and to ignite the passion that comes with anger as a way to stimulate innovative ideas and drive the uptake of new technology.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1898.html</link>
      <description>The many software development communities that have surfaced over the years have started to see an increasing relevance of social issues around them. They are not just engineering activities but full-fledged social communities. In this talk, Bdale Garbee, the Linux CTO at HP, draws a parallel between real world social communities and open source software development communities revealing similarities in the evolution of both, the issues they&amp;#039;re concerned with, from financial viability to gender issues, and the roles and responsibilities of their participants.</description>

      <description>Optaros started an internal list of open source projects that become the Enterprise Open Source Directory, a growing online community still under the editorial guidance of Optaros. The EOSD includes case studies, grouping of software by categories, and Optaros&amp;#039; trend rating showing which open source projects are stable, up-and-comers or fading glories. Gynn explains why the directory includes open source software whose license does not match the Open Software Initiative&amp;#039;s definition of open source, as well as commercial versions of open source software.</description>

      <description>Rich in linguistic play and delivered with both wit and panache, Eben Moglen&amp;#039;s talk is an intellectual delight. Beginning with a look at the history of memory from the public recording of England&amp;#039;s 11th century Domesday Book, Moglen leads us through the private memory palaces of 14th and 15th centuries to the problems of privacy that started with photographic technology. Convincing us that we have willingly given away our data and that those who now possess it have the right to use it, Moglen proposes  voluntary data collectives as the answer.  </description>

And sometimes you&#039;ve got to be the cowboy--ride into town, call the bluff, and face the music in the showdown.&amp;quot;  Dr. Elliot McGucken explains how artists can find financial success by seeing their quest as a classic Hero&#039;s Journey (ala Joseph Campbell).  By keeping the hero&#039;s goal of staying true to his art and passionately following the journey, the artist can turn his creative wealth into financial wealth.  </description>

      <description>How do you know whether a hot technology will succeed or fail? Or where the next big idea will come from? The best answers come not from the popular myths we tell about innovation, but instead from time-tested truths that explain how we&#039;ve made it this far. In The Myths of Innovation, author Scott Berkun takes a careful look at innovation history, including the software and Internet Age, to reveal how ideas truly become successful innovations-truths that people can apply to today&#039;s challenges.  He joins Phil, Scott, and Ben to discuss his new book and his career.</description>

      <description>Mobile phone shipment volumes are so huge that Microsoft and Apple aspire to capture only a fraction of the total market.

Funambol is a company and an open source community dedicated to making further mobile device interoperability progress. Will it be enough to overcome the walled gardens of the mobile device industry? Will the era of the iPhone bring further progress?</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1849.html</link>
      <description>Dryden, New York is a small town near Ithaca. Four years ago, local resident Simon St. Laurent began chronicling the civic life of the town on a blog called &amp;quot;Living in Dryden&amp;quot;. In a 2004 profile the Ithaca Journal wrote: &amp;quot;St. Laurent can be seen, notebook and digital camera in tow, at Planning Board and Conservation Advisory Council gatherings, as well as at special meetings on fire departments, speeding and comprehensive plans. What could motivate this seemingly normal man to submit himself to hours of political talk and legalese?&amp;quot;</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;It&#039;s beautiful science.&amp;quot;  Patrick Hogan, Program Manager at NASA Learning Technologies, describes World Wind, NASA&#039;s incredible free open source application that provides access to terabytes of imagery collected by NASA&#039;s satellites.  It lets you experience Earth terrain in visually rich 3D, and virtually travel to the moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and beyond.  Because it&#039;s open source, World Wind is not merely a vehicle for extraordinary astral travel and armchair universe cruising, it is spawning plug-ins, add-ons, and development in both the private and public sectors.

Wikipedia currently describes Dr. Willinsky as &amp;quot;a Canadian educator, activist, and author.&amp;quot; For him, Wikipedia is both an inspiring example of public participation in the creation of knowledge, and a wake-up call for an educational system that didn&#039;t see this revolution coming and still doesn&#039;t fully embrace its transformational power.</description>

      <description>Collectively we hold a vast repository of knowledge about how to do all sorts of things on the web: order products, conduct searches, interact in social networks. But when we try to share that knowledge with others, our options are limited. We can write down sequences of actions, and maybe illustrate them with screenshots or even screencasts, but it would be great if we could transfer our experiential knowledge more directly.  Jon Udell interviews Tessa Lau who&#039;s working with colleagues on a project that aims to make that direct transfer possible.</description>

      <description>In this interview Steve Marx, CEO of the Center for Sales Strategy and author of the book &amp;quot;Close Like the Pros,&amp;quot; introduces a whole new way of thinking about closing B2B sales, turning the old-school &amp;quot;hand-off selling&amp;quot; concept on its ear.  In Marx&#039;s interactive selling approach the sale is a process rather than an event.  He explains why interactive strategies take advantage of the current choice-filled B2B landscape, enabling more efficient, productive, and successful sales.</description>

      <title>Leonard Richardson, Sam Ruby - Jon Udell&#039;s Interviews with Innovators</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1830.html</link>
      <description>Although Roy Fielding&#039;s now-infamous Ph.D. thesis popularized the term REST - otherwise known as Representational State Transfer - and defined its principles, there hasn&#039;t been a practical guide to the application of those principles. A new book by Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby, &amp;quot;RESTful Web Services,&amp;quot; meets that need. In this Conversation with Innovators, the authors discuss what those principles are, and how to apply then in ways that make the programmable Web better - that is, &amp;quot;more uniform, better structured, and using the features of HTTP to greatest advantage.&amp;quot;</description>

      <description>Customers are now implementing solutions based upon the OASIS OpenDocument Format (ODF) and Microsoft&#039;s OpenXML standard but that&#039;s just the tip of the iceberg.  OpenDocument expert Gary Edwards believes that adopting OpenXML means lock-in to Microsoft products and services on an unprecedented scale. In this podcast, Edwards defends OpenDocument&#039;s capabilities but also challenges the ODF community to out-innovate Microsoft to provide a competitive alternative to Microsoft&#039;s lock-in.</description>

      <description>Lauren Gelman of Stanford University explain aspects of current U.S. law that protect users&#039; location and online privacy, and areas where the law fails and technology must step in. If the builders of geospatial tools fail to embrace privacy-promoting design, the potential of next-generation web applications may never be realized. Designing an architecture that protects user privacy, will pay off in the long run as people are more willing to embrace cool new tools knowing their privacy will be protected.</description>

      <description>Libraries don&#039;t always get the credit they deserve for setting information technology standards. Digital library consultant Karen Coyle describes the benefits of this work such as plug-ins for Mozilla browsers and a common standardized layer of metadata across the Web, known as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. Libraries are trying to navigate the tradeoffs between such ease of access and librarians&#039; need for control over the data in an authoritative way. </description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1753.html</link>
      <description>Since late 2005 we have seen an explosion in pushpin applications - consumer-facing web sites that let users mark, describe, and share places on a map. We don&#039;t yet know whether this is a fad like Friendster or a category killer like Wikipedia. In this session, Where 2.0 conference co-chair Nat Torkington puts the tough questions to Di-Ann Eisnor of Platial, Ben Nolan of Zopto.com, and Josh Peterson of 43places.com on money, viability, privacy, and growth. You&#039;ll learn who&#039;s doing what, why, and who has the best chances of succeeding.</description>

He shows how to establish values and then build [or rebuild] company culture, before you move on to your vision, mission, goals, and action plans.  After that, the sky&#039;s the limit.

      <title>Eben Moglen - The Renaissance of Invention: Free Software and the Next American Century</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1712.html</link>
      <description>One of the things that open source software needs the most is the full protection of the law.  Eben Moglen, Professor of Law at Columbia University Law School, congratulates the open source community on their success in becoming an important part of current technology, but also discusses how important it is to protect the user&#039;s rights. He reviews the legal atmosphere of intellectual property rights and how more restrictive to sharing they have become in recent years and how the end user has become the biggest loser because of this change.</description>

But Internet connectivity is rapidly increasing in developing nations such as India and China. There are statistics to support the claim that the percentage of online participation from these countries far outnumbers that from the West. It is expected that by the year 2030, 50% of the population of the planet will be online. What implications is that going to have on the West?</description>

In this audio lecture, Andy Goodman argues that all they have to do is tell a story. Goodman addresses social innovators over the age of 60. His ambition is nothing less than to inspire the generation of baby boomers to contribute their experience to a better world.

      <description>Open Source is here and control over software has shifted from the CIOs to the developers. They can make more decisions on what software to install and use. But with making decisions comes responsibility and the need to meet the needs of the CIO, the users and the local software environment. How can developers ensure everyone else will also be happy with the open-source software that they are happy with?</description>

      <description>What is proper balance between open source and proprietary software?  Is there a way to quantify software to come up with a good number?  In his short presentation, Robert &amp;quot;r0ml&amp;quot; Lefkowitz uses the history of the tomato as a metaphor for open source.  Using such historical events as the legal fight to have it classified as a fruit to the development of the first genetically engineered tomato, Lefkowitz compares the consumption of five fruits and vegetables a day in a balanced diet to show that a third of an organization&#039;s software should be open source.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1707.html</link>
      <description>Backed by popular Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet creator Mitch Kapor, fueled by the open source revolution, the Open Software Applications Foundation&#039;s Chandler remains a personal information manager in gestation five years after work began. Scott Rosenberg, in the new book &amp;quot;Dreaming in Code,&amp;quot; chronicles this process and reveals the hard truths that don&#039;t change from decade to decade about creating innovative software. Rosenberg also takes issue with the simplicity of David Platt&#039;s call for customers to demand that software should &amp;quot;just work.&amp;quot; </description>

      <description>According to Norman Lewis, it will take France Telecom another 30 years to see a complete return on their 3G investments. With enormous debt, legacy infrastructure, and complex revenue models at stake, it&#039;s no wonder that big telcos are having trouble adapting new Internet-enabled voice applications. Dr. Lewis describes the issue from the telco perspective and offers some guidance on how innovators and telcos will come together in the next few years.</description>

      <description>In our increasingly virtual world individuals are creating value through their every online action, but who benefits from this value? Sometimes the value is explicit - such as the information about yourself you submit to social networking or ecommerce sites. More often the value is implicit - generated through the choices you make (or don&#039;t make) in directing your attention, or the ratings you assign to other users or content. This panel discusses the issues faced by both business and consumers in generating, maintaining, understanding and benefiting from this value.</description>

      <description>Much has been done to strengthen the three major pillars of open source: licensing, business models and governance. Sun&#039;s Chief Open Source Officer Simon Phipps looks at the measures needed to ensure the Zen of Free is protected as we move into the next era of software. Along with the &amp;quot;freedom to tinker&amp;quot;, the community must defend the &amp;quot;freedom to participate&amp;quot; without undue controls, and the &amp;quot;freedom to leave&amp;quot;, an open-standards based assurance that users can move their data easily between interoperable platforms and services.</description>

      <description>While at Microsoft, Stephen Walli helped the company explore moving beyond more restricted shared-source software licensing schemes to freer GPL-oriented projects such as WIX. Now an outsider, he urges Microsoft to contribute far more into open source, and offers the new release of SQL Server as a candidate. Walli says why this type of contribution would benefit the company, and why attempting to liberate core Windows or Office software  would be much harder.</description>

      <title>Gary Lang - Opening the Possibilities: APIs and Open Source Code</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1672.html</link>
      <description>The popularity of Google Earth has helped spur the release of mapping APIs that support the development of compelling, new geospatial applications and mashups.  In this talk from OSCON 2006, Autodesk&#039;s Gary Lang explains how the progress in open standards, a shift from &#039;core to context&#039; applications, and user demand for innovation motivated his company to release the code for their popular MapServer software.  Web mapping is but one example of ways that standard APIs can create commoditization opportunities.</description>

      <description>GeoRSS allows location information to be added to an RSS feed. This gives more context to a feed by allowing it to be searched based on location or to be used by a mapping API. Mikel Maron relates how GeoRSS evolved from the W3C&#039;s Geo vocabulary and how it continues to grow and change in the light of the more recent explosion of location-based development work. Maron also presents an overview of the ingenious ways in which GeoRSS can be used and describes a number of the more innovative projects exploiting its potential.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1686.html</link>
      <description>Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, public officials have been under increasing pressure to employ identity in the name of security.

      <description>Traditional political campaigns can be seen as &amp;quot;Broadcast Politics&amp;quot; - run as a top-down hierarchy with tight control and simple sound-bite sized messages. But is this the only model that could work? In the 2004 U.S. presidential race Howard Dean became perhaps the first candidate to leverage the networking power of the internet in a national campaign. Jon Lebkowsky and Zack Rosen discuss the result of involving people at the grassroots level by providing an internet platform for campaign collaboration.</description>

In addition, consumers continue to look for ways to get what they need from businesses, rather than accepting a model based on a broken customer management system. Britt Blaser of Open Resource Group and Doc Searls, senior editor for Linux Journal, join Phil, Matt, and Scott in a discussion of the new paths of technology and how they relate to the average consumer.

Yukihiro &amp;quot;Matz&amp;quot; Matsumoto, creator of the Ruby programming language, asks whether programming languages influence human thought as well.  He shows how program language usability is important and how Ruby fits into the mold.

In addition, interesting things happen when we leave our homes and our comfort zone, perhaps in another country where business, language, food, and more is beyond our own frames of reference. Steve Portigal, founder of Portigal Consulting, offers expert tips in both observation and interviewing, and considers the challenges and opportunities in conducting research abroad.</description>

      <description>Stephen O&#039;Grady, analyst for RedMonk, argues that the trend in web technology, as well as other products, is gearing toward simplicity. Clients often demand more features and functionality, but successful products continue to be characterized by simplicity in design and simplicity in function. O&#039;Grady argues that PHP is a language that inherently supports simplicity in coding creating simpler, lighter programs with less code.</description>

      <description>In a fascinating synthesis, Robert &amp;quot;r0ml&amp;quot; Lefkowitz polishes up his exposition on the evolving meaning of the term &#039;open source&#039;. This intellectual joy-ride draws on some of the key ideas in artificial intelligence to probe the role of language, meaning and context in computing and the software development process.  Like Wittgenstein&#039;s famous thought experiment, the open source &#039;beetle in a box&#039; can represent different things to different people, bearing interesting fruit for philosophers and software creators alike.</description>

      <description>Mike Liebhold believes that significant portions of the data in our world eventually should, and will, be geocoded. He envisions a day when you can walk down the street, pull out a tricorder-like device (a la Star Trek), and have instant access to all of the cultural, social, historical, and geographical information related to your current location. In his keynote address, Liebhold makes a compelling call to action, for all concerned, to take the next steps toward the difficult, yet highly rewarding, development of a Geospatial Web.</description>

      <description>In Paul Malmont&#039;s debut novel The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril, he explores the world of pulp magazines and the men who created them. He uses the interesting tactic of populating his novel with famous pulp writers as protagonists. In this interview, Paul discusses with host Dave Slusher such subjects as how to write in styles that reflect other authors without becoming mere pastiche, the moral lessons that can be learned from pulp fiction and the lasting effects of the pulp era on science fiction and pop culture.   </description>

      <description>Talking with Globeshakers host Tim Zak, Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute argues that the United States can operate on a fourth of the energy it now uses, while still providing the same or better services. This may seem far-fetched, but Lovins has been accused of taking off on flights of fancy before, though time has a remarkable way of proving his assertions correct.

      <title>Lee, Nielsen, Bertrand, Benjamin, Jackson, Stoltz - Business Use of PHP</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1006.html</link>
      <description>PHP is progressing from the typical small- and medium-sized business project to the enterprise. Panelists discuss the reasons why companies like PayPal, Filemaker and StepUp Commerce are choosing PHP for in-house and customer application development. The recurring theme throughout is time to market. The true value in using PHP is the speed with which a solution can be created and released. Development time is reduced to a fraction of what is required by the more complex, proprietary development platforms such as Java/JSP and .Net.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1135.html</link>
      <description>Usama Fayyad, Chief Data Officer at Yahoo! believes that if the Internet is going to continue to grow, it will require a dedication to scientific excellence and the ongoing development of new scientific foundations. Many of the concepts and technologies upon which the Internet is based are still in the infancy stage, and display a lack of substance when challenged scientifically. Yahoo! has built a world-class team of scientists dedicated to the task of building this new science for the next generation Internet.  </description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail785.html</link>
      <description>Intolerance and apathy knows no bounds. Even among religions that purport to be based on love and tolerance many find it easy to fall prey to behaving and thinking in a very intolerant way. An open mind is needed to hear the message behind this insightful discussion by Sam Harris as he talks about profound fundamental religious challenges and how they can and often do translate to intolerance of others and increase the danger of keeping peace around the world.</description>

Oracle is moving towards allocation of computer resources on demand via grid computing. Ken Jacobs, VP of product strategy, explains how Oracle has begun to implement grid computing and thereby has led open source and PHP into the enterprise.</description>

      <description>As a co-founder of Netscape and co-author of Mosaic, Marc Andreessen  
has a unique view of the development of web programming. In his  
keynote address, he briefly reviews the history of the computer  
industry and how programming has moved from being machine dependent  
and complicated to become a dynamic and easy-to-learn process. In  
combination with the meteoric drop in hardware and network costs,  
more powerful applications are becoming much easier to develop  
through worldwide collaboration.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail784.html</link>
      <description>Memetics is an intellectually rich but controversial field which seeks to explain how our minds and cultures are designed by natural selection acting on replicating information, just as organisms evolve by natural selection acting on genes.  Sue Blackmore, one of the field&#039;s leading thinkers, skillfully unfolds the major arguments for a meme&#039;s-eye view of the world, and explores the implications for humanity.  Are our brains best seen as machines invented by and for propagation of selfish memes?   </description>

      <description>At Microsoft, &#039;cooperative competition&#039; is a well known strategy for success. As commercial open source continues to drive changes in the software industry, coopetition - between open source and commercial software companies alike - will be a defining factor in determining further business success and meeting customer needs.

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail859.html</link>
      <description>Thin client computing disappeared in the late 1990s but has resurfaced to great effect. These solid state devices frequently trump traditional full-size desktop solutions in terms of cost, resilience, and ease of deployment. With companies looking to cut costs in desktop appliances, this move couldn&#039;t be more timely. John Kish, President and CEO of Wyse Technology, discusses these issues, as well as describing the introduction of thin client computing in rural third world economies and how this increases the reach of the Internet. </description>

      <description>An area the size of Connecticut is being developed every year. That&amp;#039;s how fast nature is being lost to concrete in the world today. In this audio lecture recorded at Bridging the Gap, the Stanford 2005 Net Impact conference, Will Rogers discusses strategies for sustainable land use in a context where the boundaries that separate land conservation from public health, housing, economic development, transit, energy-use policies, and urban design are rapidly blurring.

      <title>Robert Neuwirth - Habitat</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail780.html</link>
      <description>This talk from the Habitats session at Pop!Tech 2005 features Robert Neuwirth, a journalist who looks at the habitats where we live. Squatters steal water and electricity to make their lives livable. They use scavenged materials to help create better living conditions and as they gradually build more permanent living spaces, cityscapes begin to be established. The community rises in a free-spirited way and eventually we reach a suburban ideal. Neuwirth explores what he considers to be the cities of the future. </description>

      <description>Craigslist is the electronic version of a flea market. Unlike the typical corporate site, Craig Newmark, founder and customer service rep for Craigslist, believes that the regular user is the person who can best police things and that the biggest mistake he could make would be a failure to trust. He admits that things aren&#039;t always perfect, particularly with spam and organized scams, but that by nuturing the good guys, the response will be positive.

      <description>Blogging is often associated with citizen journalism and new media sources for news and analysis of topics like technology and politics.  However, according to Anil Dash of SixApart, many people who blog are doing it more to have personal conversations with friends, family, and people who share their interests. He argues that the ability for people to share personal information with others, who are interested in that topic, is the real power of blogs and that personal content holds as much, if not more, value than the so-called A-list.</description>

      <title>Jonathan Schwartz - Future of the Tech Industry</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1127.html</link>
      <description>Jonathan Schwartz, CEO of Sun Microsystems, sits down with Supernova host Kevin Werbach, to discuss the technology industry and what he views as the key opportunities for his company. He says Sun will differentiate between those who view IT as a cost center, and those who will use IT as a means of growing their business. Sun wants to focus on the latter, and with the proper investment in R&amp;amp;D, provide the products these companies will rely upon to connect themselves to their communities of interest. </description>

      <title>Making Money - Bloggercon III</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail284.html</link>
      <description>How would you like it if, every time you got a phone call, you had to listen to an advertisement as well? Have you ever asked, How do I make money with my telephone? Or, What&#039;s the business model of my telephone? Or, What&#039;s the business model of my water cooler? My front porch? My patio?  Doc Searls believes it&#039;s far more important (and interesting) to make money because of our blogs, rather than with them; just as we make money because we have phones rather than with our phones. </description>

      <title>Derek Powazek - The New Community</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1089.html</link>
      <description>How have communities on the Internet changed recently? Derek Powazek of Technorati asserts that, until recently, online communities resembled company towns where the voice of each participant was at the will of a single entity. Today, however, each participant has authority over their own node in a community, making the community as a whole more self-powered and independent. Powazek discusses the essence of the new community, as it is framed by current Web 2.0 trends.

      <description>The information age is wreaking havoc on the way we measure and manage our businesses. Many of the new, &amp;quot;intangible&amp;quot; assets, created by our state-of-the-art technologies, will never appear on an old fashioned balance sheet. And new ways of working are scrambling the traditional managament hierachy. In this MeshForum 2006 session, Verna Allee says the concept of &amp;quot;Value Networks&amp;quot; can give us the metrics and perspective businesses and individuals need to thrive in the 21st century.</description>

In this talk, Bart Decrem demonstrates a variety of cool features which the Flock team hopes will transform web browsing from the static consumption of documents to more active participation in a shared stream of integrated services, bookmarks, tags and blogs. This new paradigm of social web browsing is likely to appeal to early adopters looking to immerse themselves in the new, social life of the web.</description>

He introduces the initial Google Maps API and asserts that it provides the map as a canvas for custom content. As the API is free to all web sites that are free to consumers, everyone can now have a Google map on their home page.</description>

      <description>Harnessing legal music on the web is primarily hampered by a lack of data. Traditional record labels are unsure of the true nature of this emerging industry and have little idea how to turn a profit. John Heilemann leads Jeffrey Mallett and Mickey Hart in a discussion of the evolving landscape of online music distribution and how current solutions, like Apple&amp;#039;s iTunes, need to change and improve. Mallet, as chairman of SNOCAP, explains how his company&amp;#039;s business model will alter the concept of music distribution from an artist&amp;#039;s perspective.</description>

Taking a cue from Francis Fukuyama&#039;s assertion that one of society&#039;s most valuable resources is the number of people you know and can trust, Lightman believes that we inhabit a permissive universe that responds positively when people make definite decisions to act. </description>

But as storage costs plummet and investment in search technology soars, what does the future hold for the data we&#039;re creating right now? How can we best protect our future selves from the quiet hard drives of today, and what might it mean to have an &amp;quot;open data&amp;quot; movement?

Yochai Benkler, one of the top thinkers on commons-based approaches to managing resources, weaves together several fascinating threads to argue that decentralization and collaboration are shifting the balance of power to the people in the production of knowledge, goods and services; creating an economy where resources are not owned and outputs are shared. </description>

      <description>AOL is one of a handful of truly global web brands. Chairman and CEO Jonathan F. Miller talks to John Batelle about AOL&#039;s future needs and its transition to the Web 2.0 mindset at the 2005 Web 2.0 conference. Miller stresses the need for AOL to focus on balancing traditional and user-generated content, while maintaining its key position and web brand. This approach is made more difficult because, although AOL seeks to expand beyond its current technological and geopolitical boundaries, it continues to be faithful to its origins as an ISP.</description>

Stone explores how we pay attention to each other, how our attention patterns have shifted, and considers new technologies and new interfaces. Is constantly scanning the periphery to see if something more important should displace our current activity really the best way to live?</description>

With open source becoming more important to the software industry, understanding the three layers will help a developer be more efficient.</description>

      <title>Manuel Lima - Mapping Complex Networks</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1066.html</link>
      <description>&quot;The challenge is not so much to discover new networks, but to understand the ones that already exist.&quot; According to Manuel Lima, the creator of VisualComplexity.com, the transition from information to knowledge is a significant hurdle. Mapping information, especially information within a complex network is an especially useful tool to clear that hurdle. In his keynote address to the MeshForum, held May 7, 2006 in San Francisco, CA, Manuel Lima identifies key characteristics of a good network map and shares some of his favorite projects.</description>

      <description>The future of social mobile applications is wide open, according to the Where 2.0 Social Application panelists. They expect to see many new applications with clean, rich client interfaces that provide significantly more functionality and manageability than is currently available. However, they are all quick to point out that the future is as much about social aspects as about the technology. The discussion focuses on breaking down barriers and energizing participation, as well as controlling usage and unforeseen behaviors.</description>

This legacy sometimes obscures the fact that Lisp is also a mature, modern language with a lot of practical benefits. Programmers and anyone interested in the progress of computation will want to tune in as Phil Windley speaks with Peter Seibel, author of the best selling Practical Common Lisp, to answer the question, why Lisp?</description>

      <description>Microsoft&#039;s approach to software development may seem at odds with Open Source goals, but for those engaged in the company&#039;s Shared Source initiative, there is more common ground than you might think.  For the past five years, Microsoft has been steadily increasing its connections with the open development community through active participation in dozens of projects on SourceForge.net.  In this talk, Jason Matusow explains how the world&#039;s biggest proprietary software house has been striking the balance between community and commercialization.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail736.html</link>
      <description>The US Patent System no longer functions in the way that it was intended.  Obvious and trival patents have been granted, even in some cases where there is an existing product and the idea is not new.  Beth Noveck has more modern ideas that leverage powerful existing technologies like collaborative filtering to reinvent this overwhelmed system.  Using a peer-to-peer system of experts in a given field, the US Patent Office could elminate many of the road-blocks holding up the current system and also grant fewer specious or duplicate patents.

      <description>The European Union&#039;s Lisbon Agenda laid out a ten year plan to produce the world&#039;s leading knowledge economy by 2010, but all the while the US continues to dominate the software sector. Case in point, open source software innovations that begin in Europe often end up migrating their talents and profits to the US. In this presentation, Paul Everitt makes a compelling case that economic goals of Open Source entrepreneurs and the political goals of the EU planners have much to offer each other.                  </description>

      <link>http://sic.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail2929.html</link>
      <description>The nonprofit sector delivers social value and the for-profit sector delivers economic value, right? Wrong! Speaking at Bridging the Gap, the 2005 Stanford Net Impact conference, Jed Emerson argues that value is non-divisible, whole, and blended. In this audio lecture, he invites us to think beyond philanthropy, corporate social responsibility, social enterprise, and other limiting mindsets.

      <description>Are there educational benefits to be gained from participating in video game play?  Stephen Berlin Johnson, author of Everything Bad Is Good for You, discusses how video games have changed significantly over the past three decades.

      <description>Jason Fried treats the Web 2.0 2005 Conference audience to a talk about how to create a Web 2.0 company and how to do more by focusing on the idea of less. He confronts conventional business building practices and proposes the idea of &quot;under-doing&quot; the competition. Having less produces more constraints, which, in turn, yields better products and increased customer satisfaction. </description>

      <description>In this Intelligence Amplification Panel, Ruzena Bajcsy, Dr. Shun-Jie Ji, Janardhan Chodagam, and Robin Raskin discuss how accelerating technology can be applied to education. Can we incorporate 3D object mapping to share rare artifacts, while encouraging the young to think about the long-term future? Can using meditation to study our own thought processes lead to artificial intelligence amplification? Maybe we&#039;re moving too fast, and the introduction of our increasingly powerful tools to the inexperienced youth is detrimental to their long-term development. </description>

      <description>It is human nature to resist change. So one might ask, how could a group hope to bring about major social, economic, political, religious or cultural changes in a non-violent way, or know if the means one chooses would provide the desired result, or create new problems? In this session, Ivan Marovic talks about a new game that helps address these issues. Through his experiences in the Otpor (resistance), Ivan Marovic was key in shaping a new online game where people can play out real world scenarios and strategies in a virtual world.</description>

As more of our interactions take place online, clearly establishing whom we are has become essential. How do you prove you are a legitimate user, let alone that you should be treated specially? In the sequel to his Identity 2.0 talk, Hardt shares his vision for how users and sites will communicate identity.</description>

      <description>&quot;Net neutrality&quot; is a principle that specifies that all participants on the Internet travel on the same virtual highways at the same speed regardless of their ability to pay.  This doesn&#039;t mean that companies can&#039;t pay for super fast servers or high-speed access but it means that the speed that data is routed over the Internet infrastructure itself is based on available bandwidth.  In this conversation with Larry Magid, Craig Newmark of Craigslist talks about why Net Neutrality is important.</description>

      <description>The rosy picture often painted of our world transformed by high tech successes ignores some serious problems with quality. Michael Tiemann argues something must be done, and soon, since much of our current software functions poorly, and the cost of IT to business is far too high. Open source can help break this jam by designing and building quality into products and processes. An essential step is the recognition that the design problem, and its solution, belong to everyone. </description>

      <description>The China Project offers a rare opportunity to study disease in a precise manner because of the unique conditions that exist in rural China. For example, about 90% of the people in rural China live their entire lives in the vicinity of their birth. They also consume diets composed primarily of locally produced foods. These factors make rural China a living laboratory for the study of the complex relationship between nutrition and other lifestyle factors and degenerative diseases.</description>

      <title>Rael Dornfest - Attenuation is the New Aggregation</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail870.html</link>
      <description>The attention economy promises to harness the power of the network, but in the meantime, we are being deluged by the glut of information. Alpha geeks may rejoice as they imagine new heuristics to catch up with this information overload. In reality, every waking moment has been absorbed by the task of simply keeping up. In this talk, Rael Dornfest delivers an entertaining riff on the potential for attenuation to tame the infosphere by distilling out the most interesting and useful bits from the network soup.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1026.html</link>
      <description>It&#039;s time to get excited about software again. Software spending is up, capital investment is up, but what does Web 2.0 really mean for the enterprise?  Vanessa Colella blends optimism with practical suggestions on how software companies can move to the next phase by understanding their niche in the customer&#039;s ecosystem. Shifting the focus from the provider to the customer will help companies rise to the new challenges of supporting tacit interactions, those messy decisions-based problems which businesses, and software vendors, must now face.</description>

      <description>William Quigley, managing director of Clearstone Venture Partners, believes that the incumbent RBOCs will remain strong as they continue to reinvent and reinvest in infrastructure. Where  are the emerging opportunities in telephony? Mr. Quigley identifies two areas for telephony entrepeneurs. First, focus on areas in which the big RBOCs are not as strong - applications and managed services. Second, with projections that two-thirds of all network connections will be mobile by 2009, pay close attention to new trends in wireless and mobile VOIP.</description>

      <description>Security and validation are critical issues in computing, and the next fifty years will be harder than the last.  There are a number of proven programming techniques and design approaches which are already helping to harden our modern systems, but each of these must be carefully balanced with usability in order to be effective.  In this talk, Alan Cox, fellow at Red Hat Linux, explores the future of what may be the biggest threat facing software engineers, the unverified user.</description>

Stephen Randall, CEO of LocaModa and founder of Symbian, explains that, without a strategy to connect the dots between these four screens, the target market or many products and services might just as well be on the dark side of the moon.

      <description>Changes in technology and in how information is shared both further and faster are transforming how organizations operate. Thomas Malone, of the MIT Sloan School of Management, shows how the changes in organizational structure mirror changes in how human society has organized and operated. His presentation illustrates that these changes can be primarily tied by a single factor, the cost of communication, and he presents present-day examples to show what the organization of the future may look like.</description>

      <description>Jeff Waugh takes up Asa Dotzler&#039;s provocative OSCON challenge to software developers engaged in the &quot;Search for the Linux Desktop&quot;. Dotzler claimed that for Linux to please a mainstream audience it must still solve migration, stability, simplicity and comfort issues on the desktop.  Waugh gives a lively and entertaining rebuttal, pointing to usability improvements in GNOME 2.0, and demonstrating the virtue of action phrases and special de-geeking glasses that let developers see things as an end user would.

      <description>The hardest part of predicting the future is that it&#039;s, well, the future.  That may sound flippant, but it&#039;s essentially true; the greatest problem in forecasting isn&#039;t understanding the current situation or the problem itself, it&#039;s accounting for unforeseen factors the cannot be predicted. In a session from Pop!Tech 2005, essayist and former financial trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb discusses these &quot;black swans&quot; and their effect on the task of forecasting.</description>

Like medicine, software engineering should require &quot;years of tortured residency.&quot;  Homeland Security should work with hackers to fight terrorism.  We should discard our firewalls and let broadband carriers filter attacks in the cloud.

Maya Design&#039;s Josh Knauer explains how the Information Commons sets about answering these questions.</description>

      <description>The Internet is truly becoming an open network with the rise of amateur content and open source software. In this talk, Joi Ito takes us through the growth of the internet as an open network in layers to the point where the killer app is now user generated content. Earlier, it was the little guys around the edges of the internet who created the open standards which made the web work, and today it is those same people who fuel it with their creativity. Joi also shares with us his observations of the remix culture seen on the net. [Accelerating Change audio from IT Conversations]</description>

      <description>More and more people are using mobile phones with integral video cameras to capture events. Some of the most harrowing pictures from the London bomb attacks in July came from amateur video taken underground by passengers with camera phones. We seem to be heading towards a future where everything we experience will be captured and stored for retrieval. Perhaps only the sheer scale of the numbers of people involved will be the biggest safeguard we have against the nightmare of &#039;Big Brother&#039; surveillance.

This panel discussion, moderated by Simon St. Laurent of O&#039;Reilly Media, brings together five leaders from diverse sources to talk about the challenges inherent in the collection of mapping data.

      <description>Open Source software has yet to make substantial inroads into the Enterprise market, but when companies as established as Computer Associates not only release a technology as powerful an the Ingres database but also continue to build their enterprise applications on that platform, the combination adds stability to Open Source efforts.  In this Keynote from O&#039;Reilly&#039;s 2005 Open Source Convention, Tony Gaughan, Senior VP of Product Development at CA, discusses CA&#039;s decision to release the Ingres database to the open source community.

The granddaddy of Google&#039;s mapping tools, though, is Google Earth - a downloadable client that allows the user to virtually fly over the world and view satellite imagery from almost anywhere.  Prior to its acquisition by Google, John Hanke was CEO of Keyhole, the company that built the application that is at the core of Google Earth.  In this talk from Where 2.0, he demonstrates some of the secrets of Google Earth. [Where 2.0 audio from IT Conversations]</description>

      <description>For enterprise application development, the high-end &quot;superplatforms&quot; like J2EE and .NET aren&#039;t the only choice.  Developers can choose from the &quot;rebel platforms,&quot; open-source platforms that don&#039;t adhere to industry standards like J2EE or .NET.  In this session from the Application Platform Strategies track at Burton Group&#039;s 2005 Catalyst Conference, Richard Monson-Haefel describes the rebel platforms, compares then with superplatforms from Microsoft, SAP, IBM, Oracle, and BEA on criteria including flexibility, risk, lock-in, development complexity, and cost.

      <title>The Prospects for AI - Accelerating Change 2005</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail713.html</link>
      <description>Neil Jacobstein, Patrick Lincoln, Peter Norvig, and Bruno Olshausen offer four penetrating examinations of the current and future prospects for the differing technologies of artificial intelligence and the science that underpins them. Increasingly, to the satisfaction of advocates of biologically-inspired design, it seems that the best of the new AI enablers look to neuroscience for the most useful basis for their theoretical models.

      <description>Play affects children&amp;#039;s quality of life. Yet, in many communities, schools, and families, this element has been pushed to the back burner. In an udio interview with Globeshakers host Tim Zak, Darrell Hammond envisions a great place to play within walking distance of every child in America. Since 1995, KaBOOM! has used its innovative community-build model to bring together business and community interests to construct more than 850 new playgrounds and skateparks, and renovate 1,300 others nationwide.

      <description>Google&#039;s mission is to organize the world&#039;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. With this in mind, the company recently launched video search to make visual content such as TV shows and online videos more easily accessible. In an unscheduled and wide ranging interview with John Battelle at Web 2.0, Google co-founder Sergey Brin describes his belief that the company is a technology leader rather than a content-rich portal like some of its competitors.

      <description>Our society is becoming increasingly reliant on GPS signals for outdoor location positioning and tracking, but these signals don&#039;t reach indoors or into urban canyons. To resolve this problem, a new location technology using commercial broadcast television signals provides reliable location information to augment or replace GPS.

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail675.html</link>
      <description>For the last 15 years, the corporate workforce has become increasingly mobile and distributed. This has led to the phasing out of traditional administration support for large numbers of workers. However, as knowledge workers assume the burden of administration and attempt to leverage improvements in technology, they have reached the point of diminishing returns. Patrick Grady sees the creation of a &quot;services-on-demand&quot; grid as the only viable solution for this information overload. [Supernova 2005 audio from IT Conversations]

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail656.html</link>
      <description>The core design of Perl 6 is largely complete, to the extent that the language is now being implemented in earnest. In Larry Wall&#039;s ninth annual State of the Onion address, he explains Perl 6&#039;s Five Year Plan, how Perl programmers are like spies (or vice versa), and how open source can learn from the intelligence community.

      <description>It&#039;s hard to know what&#039;s more significant about Apple&#039;s video iPod. Is it the hardware -- thinner device, more storage, larger screen and video for the same price -- or is it the deals that Apple struck with Disney/ABC for television content? Host Larry Magid grills Eddy Cue, the VP of iTunes at Apple, to try and find out what the secret sauce might be that has given Apple a 75% marktet share in portable audio players despite what should be competitive devices from other vendors.

However, the same images can also be used for civilian purposes, in cases such as monitoring reconstruction activity in regions hit by disaster.

      <title>George Gilder - Larry&#039;s World</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail669.html</link>
      <description>&quot;Many people still have this nostalgic belief that China somehow continues to be Communist, when in fact, in their constitution in 2003 they incorporated a provision upholding the sanctity of private property,&quot; begins George Gilder in his interview with Larry Magid. Gilder believes that China has become a consumer country by building 60 nuclear plants. The Chinese government uses science and technology in a realistic way because China is run by engineers, not lawyers. This is just one of the controversial subjects touched on by Magid and Gilder in this interview. [Larry&#039;s World audio from IT Conversations]

It would be useful, too, if advertisers could use location-based services to target potential customers more accurately. Microsoft Virtual Earth provides APIs to do both of these things - and more. In this lively presentation, Stephen Lawler of Microsoft Corp. introduces us to the potential of MSN Virtual Earth. [Where 2.0 audio from IT Conversations]

In a discussion that will resonate with any blogger who isn&#039;t a household name, Charlene Li and Halley Suitt spark a debate about how women bloggers define and achieve success.

But without some knowledge of the arrangements under which packets are moved from one network to another, the foundations of the global infrastructure remain hidden and consumers have no way of knowing the commercial factors that frame the accessibility of bandwidth.  This is one of many policy questions discussed in the Policy Workshop Panel from Supernova 2005.  [Supernova 2005 Audio from IT Conversations]</description>

      <description>What does the military see in emerging technologies? The military wants to remix technologies to allow the soldiers on the edges to communicate with those in the center. J.C. Herz looks at two specific technologies that the military is attempting to remix into a viable reapplication of code for their benefit. It&#039;s not always easily accomplished. Four misunderstood lines of code destroyed a missile during launch to the tune of $1 billion. [Emerging Technology Conference 2005 audio from IT Conversations]</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail633.html</link>
      <description>What do historical maps show and what do they hide? How were the cartographers over the centuries biased? How can these old maps be used, superimposed and blended with current maps to show the changes in topography over the centuries? How can old maps be &amp;quot;remixed&amp;quot; with current information to reveal interesting information about cities? David Rumsey talks about the evolution of maps over the centuries and how they can be used to reveal interesting information. [Where 2.0 audio from IT Conversations]</description>

      <description>Now ten years old, and with 975,000 independent vendors, Amazon.com is one of the classic long-tail online companies. Its new CTO, Werner Vogels, talks openly with Halley Suitt about the company, their policies for making data available to others (while protecting customers&#039; privacy, and the state of search engines. Werner says that search is still in its infancy, but it&#039;s like dancing bears: the novelty alone makes it look pretty good.
Internally, Amazon.com is &quot;organized chaos,&quot; deploying small teams to implement new systems. Externally, they&#039;ve learned valuable lessons from the knowledge of their customers&#039;reviews to build out a large-scale network
of shared intelligence. [Memory Lane with Halley Suitt audio from IT Conversations]</description>

Do you have a need to bridge the gaps between different enterprise software application and home-grown solutions? Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is one part of the toolkit that can help enterprises overcome these difficulties, and yet in a study done by InfoWorld and BEA, only 28% of respondents have a current SOA project, while more than 50% have no current SOA plans. BEA Systems Chief Technology Office Mark Carges discusses the results of this study and the needs for an SOA infrastructure in this keynote from InfoWorld&#039;s SOA Executive Forum.

The answers to this question can be found by studying the underlying socio-technological motivations for the creation, maintenance, destruction, and reconstitution of knowledge and social networks. Dr. Noshir Contractor discusses some of his research in communication theory of dynamically linked knowledge networks over the past ten years at MeshForum 2005 through the examination of real-world examples.

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail596.html</link>
      <description>&quot;95% of the shows fail!&quot; states Mark Cuban. Of course, he would know best - he&#039;s responsible for pioneering streaming media with Broadcast.com which he sold to Yahoo! for millions of dollars. He&#039;s also the man behind the success of the Dallas Mavericks. And now he&#039;s trying to do the same with HDNet: bring high definition programming to your living room. Host Larry Magid talks to Cuban about everything from piracy to the special makeup required for HDTV. [Larry&#039;s World audio from IT Conversations]</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail528.html</link>
      <description>Most IT buyers would agree that software vendor behavior has improved over the past few years. Since the recession when businesses dramatically slashed IT budgets, software companies have had little choice but to improve customer relations and product quality in order to remain competitive. But this panel of CIOs says there is still much room for improvement in areas such as consolidation, pricing, quality and security. [Software 2005 audio from IT Conversations]</description>

      <description>Isn&#039;t radio an old, dying medium?  What&#039;s it doing in a conference on emerging technologies?  Matt Biddulph, Paul Hammond, Tom Coates, and Matt Webb show us how radio is a reemerging technology experiencing a resurgence in popularity and relevance.  They explore how radio can be improved by introducing feedback mechanisms and by ultimately making it a more social medium.  Using principles of social software, the BBC becomes more of a peer than a broadcaster. [ETech 2005 audio from IT Conversations]</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail527.html</link>
      <description>Although technology is still changing everything, we&#039;ve come to view it as on a par with indoor plumbing. This suggests the industry is mature and unlikely to produce another upswing to match that of the 90s. Add to this the growing demands of globalization, and you could believe it was time to get out of the technology business completely. Roger McNamee&#039;s talk at this year&#039;s Software 2005 Conference should give you the confidence to keep going. He examines the new rules that need to be learned and followed in this era of the &#039;new normal&#039; and shows how the problems faced both by companies and technology staff can be turned into golden opportunities.

      <title>Jonathan Schwartz - Supernova 2005</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail588.html</link>
      <description>In the openening session from Supernova 2005, host Kevin Werbach interviews Jonathan Schwartz, president of Sun Microsystems. They cover a lot of ground, but the dominant theme is the ways in which technology and control of technolgy are decentralizing: moving into the hands of users. As Kevin suggests, consider a world in which one billion people will have camera-enabled mobile devices.
&lt;p&gt;
Innovation certainly isn&#039;t dead, says Jonathan. As computing continues to get cheaper (a trend that began when employees demanded PCs from formerly centralized IT departments), decision making also migrates to lower levels within organizations. It&#039;s massive decentralization. It&#039;s even having an effect on media and entertainment, as users demand that they be able to listen and watch what they want and when they want.
&lt;p&gt;
It wouldn&#039;t be an interview with Jonathan if the subject of blogging by executives of public companies didn&#039;t come up. He describes what he&#039;s learned about public and internal blogging -- Are they really separate? -- and the importance of openness and transparency, even in public, or perhaps particulary in public.

      <description>From Gnomedex 4.0: The Geeks-Gone-Wild crowd was glued to this rare and brilliant presentation by Steve Wozniak, a geek&amp;#039;s geek. It started with games and pranks, crystal-set radios, reading Popular Electronics. Then he met Captain Crunch and got into telco-busting Blue Boxes. Woz wanted to be an HP engineer forever and never thought he&amp;#039;d start a company, but his friend, Steve Jobs, said, &amp;quot;Let&amp;#039;s sell it!&amp;quot; at every opportunity. Good thing he did, and good thing HP turned down Woz&amp;#039;s offer for the rights to build what would become Apple&amp;#039;s first computer.

Kim Polese, CEO of SpikeSource, doesn&#039;t think so and makes a convincing case that the software industry is undergoing a revolution, which will create even further innovations. This is known as Web 2.0 and it is changing that way software companies are executing their

      <description>Schools need a system which is simple to use for the teachers as well as the students; one that is secure; which does not require dedicated tech support. And all this without using data servers because the powers-that-be frown on schools setting up servers by themselves. Tom Hoffman and Tim Lauer describe the challenges they have faced in doing this and how they have overcome them with SchoolTool, in their interesting talk at Etech 2005.

      <title>Will Wright - Lessons from Game Design</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail195.html</link>
      <description>Will Wright, creator of The Sims, considers the impact auto racing (visibility, technologies) has had on the automotive industry. Computer games have evolved into a similar relationship with the computer industry. Because we get to design the problems that our players face (the game challenges) we have an opportunity to push the boundaries of graphics, user interface, AI, metrics and simulation. What we&#039;re currently learning about mapping these abilitites to the psychology of our players will be used in the mainstream software of the future.</description>

      <description>Are unlimited copying, anonymity and unreliability limitations of the Internet or features? Promoters of copyfight, e-voting, spamfighting and trusted computing all will answer that they are obviously bugs. Cory Doctrow presents an alternative view of the Internet as a complex system with parasitic and often beneficial elements. He argues that, despite what some would have us believe, the Internet is not broken and that efforts to make it better highlight how business interests, lobbyists and technologists who don&#039;t understand can do more harm than good.

      <description>Unlike architects (who figure out what to build) and engineers (who figure out how), great hackers and painters do both. Who makes a good hacker and how can you identify a good hacker/programmer in a job interview? Why is empathy an important skill for programmers? As a hacker who also studied painting in Europe, Paul may be uniquely qualified to write a book entitled &lt;i&gt;Hackers and Painters&lt;/i&gt;. If you leave your day programming job only to get home and write more code, this is a great book for you. </description>

Peter Yared, who headed up the Liberty Alliance project at Sun, took notice, left Sun and founded ActiveGrid, a company dedicated to building Web applications upon LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP/Python/Perl), XML, Javascript and DHTML. As for grids, Yared maintains there are really three types: computational, utility (on-demand) and transaction grids (an example of which is ActiveGrid). He explains what makes a transaction grid different than using conventional load balancing software. How does ActiveGrid stack up against Microsoft&#039;s forthcoming Indigo? Why did ActiveGrid choose the Apache open source license for its base technology?</description>

Speaking with host Larry Magid, Kitch shares his expertise on designing and presenting information on the web, pointing out that most sites on the web are fairly ugly. People tend to over design their own sites, says Kitch or hire professionals who overuse technology to justify what they&#039;re charging the client.</description>

      <description>The ability to innovate is at the core of every successful and enduring business. Dr. Irving Wladawsky-Berger, head of IBM&#039;s e-business on demand initiative, delivers an engaging keynote address at OSBC 2005, on Innovation in an  On Demand World. Irving sees innovation happening on many fronts but of particular interest is the innovation that is occurring at the technological, business and societal levels, which is causing a major shift in the way that businesses compete. No longer is everything proprietary or core to the business. To remain competitive the business must embrace innovation at the technological, business and societal levels.

      <title>Corporate Blogging - Sound Policy with Denise Howell</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail504.html</link>
      <description>With Technorati tracking over 8.7 million weblogs, and Perseus
estimating some 53.4 million hosted blogs will exist by year end,
there is no question blogs have a firm hold on the fabric of society
and show no signs of letting go.  As blogging&#039;s popularity spreads, a
recurring area of tension is the relationship between businesses,
employees, and the blogs each may be writing.  In this installment of
Sound Policy, Denise Howell talks with George Lenard, Steve Rubel, and
Jeff Seul, all of whom have unique perspectives on the business
implications of weblogging:  what are the smartest strategies for
businesses and individuals, and what legal issues are legitimate
concerns? [Sound Policy audio on IT Conversations]</description>

      <title>Clayton Christensen - Capturing the Upside</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail135.html</link>
      <description>What decisions can managers take to increase their probability of successfully building innovation-driven growth businesses? Many are convinced that it is impossible to predict with confidence whether an innovation will succeed, so they feel they need to place a number of bets with the hope that some will be winners.   Others believe that the best way to create new growth businesses is to meticulously search for detailed quantitative data to identify opportunities and develop a rigorous plan to attack those opportunities. But many times conclusive data is only available after the game has already been won. Professor Christensen has another way. He suggests using theory. Every action a manager takes, every plan a manager makes is based on some belief of cause and effect.

How can powerful brands like the New York Times thrive in an age where content is understood to be free?

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail193.html</link>
      <description>MGM v. Grokster: On August 19th, 2004, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decided whether
distributors of peer-to-peer filesharing software, such as Grokster
and StreamCast, could be held liable for the copyright infringements
of their users. The court said that, under the circumstances, no. The
case has many ramifactions for technologists and innovators. Ernest
Miller discusses the decision with four leading legal analysts,
including Fred von Lohmann of the EFF, who argued the case.</description>

      <title>Ray Lane - Software: To Infinity and Beyond</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail484.html</link>
      <description>In this keynote address from the Software 2004 conference, venture capitalist Ray Lane (Kleiner, Perkins) takes a high-level and long-term view of the software industry. What&#039;s next? Is there a new economy after all? What about the claims that IT doesn&#039;t matter and that innovation is dead? Perhaps this is a rare period of normalcy.

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail324.html</link>
      <description>We&#039;ve got an amazing panel of experts to discuss the future of the telephone as a platform. Our panel of experts includes: Om Malik, Senior Writer, Business 2.0; Jeffrey A. Citron, Chairman &amp; CEO, Vonage; Hossein Eslambolchi, President of AT&amp;T&#039;s Global Networking Technology Services, and AT&amp;T&#039;s CTO &amp; CIO; Charlie E. Hoffman, CEO, Covad; and Mike McCue, President, COO &amp; Co-Founder, Tellme.
&lt;p&gt;
As anyone who has traveled outside the US will attest, what used to be the telephone has become a primary data platform for much of the world. But that&#039;s just the start of a new world order for our venerable communications device. Major players like Cisco and AT&amp;T are pushing VOIP, as upstarts like Vonage declare open season on crumbling telephony models. Our panel of experts from across this landscape will make sense of the historic -- and increasingly robust -- telephony platform. [Web 2.0 audio from IT Conversations]</description>

      <description>&quot;Simulation, Agents, and Accelerating Change: Personality Capture and the Linguistic User Interface,&quot; presented by John Smart at Accelerating Change 2004: One of the most important accelerating transitions occuring today is the emergence of the Linguistic User Interface or LUI. What will Windows (and the Google Browser) of 2015 look like? It seems clear that it will include sophisticated software simulations of human beings as part of the interface. First-world culture today spends more on video games than movies. These &quot;interactive motion picture&quot; technologies are more compelling and educating, particularly to our youth, the fastest-learning segment of society, than any linear scripts, no matter how professionally produced.

      <description>It&#039;s another new IT Conversations series: Sound Policy with Denise Howell.
&lt;p&gt;
In this first edition, Denise hosts a spirited debate about Google&#039;s controversial AutoLink feature. Her guests are Cory Doctorow, Martin Schwimmer and Robert Scoble.
&lt;p&gt;
Google is no stranger to providing invaluable services to users of the Web, and the Google Toolbar has been no exception.  However, the beta release of the Google Toolbar 3, with its link-adding AutoLink feature, has many wondering if Google has forgotten its &quot;don&#039;t be evil&quot; credo.  In the debut of the Sound Policy series, Denise talks with Cory, Robert and Martin, all of whom have been outspoken about AutoLink:  what it might mean for Web publishers and users, and how it might be impacted by intellectual property law.

&lt;p&gt;
Grassroots journalists are dismantling Big Media&#039;s monopoly on the news, changing it from lecture to conversation. Dan Gillmor discusses the importance of this emerging phenomenon, a deep shift in how we make and consume the news. We the Media is essential reading for all participants in the news cycle: Consumers learn how they can become producers of the news through web journals (weblogs or blogs), Internet chat groups, email, and cell phones.

      <description>How do you establish trust between between strangers on the Internet?
Identity federation is one way to create a community of trust, but it
relies on establishing the trust domains before the interaction.  That
doesn&#039;t work for many Internet transactions. Phil Windley interviews Professor Kent Seamons to discuss some specific ways of solving this problem. [IT Conversations audio of Phil&#039;s Technometria series]</description>

      <description>Search is an application that binds the web&#039;s economic, interface, and partnership landscape. Through search, companies like Google and Yahoo have built extraordinarily scaled platforms that have evolved into next generation web-based applications like mail, hosting, and, some claim, an entire OS. Pioneers and leaders in the search business reflect on the present and future of the search platform. John Battelle moderates a panel of search-engine experts who explore the future of search as an application platform. [Audio from the Web 2.0 Conference on IT Conversations]</description>

      <title>Clark Aldrich - Simulations and the Future of Learning</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail372.html</link>
      <description>Clark Aldrich, co-founder of SimuLearn and the author of, &lt;em&gt;Simulations and the Future of Learning&lt;/em&gt; delivered this presentation at Accelerating Change 2004:
&lt;p&gt;
Six criteria are emerging as critical not just to simulations but to all successful educational experiences. Three are focused on content, and three on delivery elements. The key criteria for content are: 1. Linear content. 2. Systems of content. 3. Cyclical content. Additional criteria for delivery elements are: 4. Simulation elements that model reality. 5. Game elements that provide familiar and entertaining interactions. 6. Pedagogical (didactic) elements that ensure the students&#039; time is spent productively. As we understand pedagogy (#6) and linear content (#1), we first mourn that they have become so dominant, but then realize how powerful they are in concert. It is only through the interelationships of all six criteria that we begin to get results that can truly transform people. [Accelerating Change 2004 audio from IT Conversations]</description>

      <description>Within five years, our personal computers will be able to store everything we read, write, hear, and many of the images we see including a bit of video. Vannevar Bush outlined such a system in his famous 1945 Memex article. Since 2000 a team at Microsoft has been working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mylifebits.com&quot;&gt;MyLifeBits&lt;/a&gt; to hold all cyberizable items from both personal and profession lives including articles, books, email and written correspondence, photos, telephone calls, video files, web pages visited. They are extending the reach to capture psychological data through wearable devices e.g. the SenseCam from Microsoft&#039;s Cambridge Lab, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.BodyMedia.com&quot;&gt;BodyMedia&lt;/a&gt;.While such a system has implications for future computing devices and their users, these systems will only exist if we can effectively utilize the vast personal stores.

      <title>Let the Mobile Games Begin - SofTECH</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail417.html</link>
      <description>Cell phone entertainment is hot and growing fast, and SofTECH has brought panel of experts together to discuss pending business opportunities. The global entertainment software market is currently estimated to be in excess of $3 billion. Cell phone games alone are currently $200 million to $300 million in the United States, and between $800 million and $1 billion globally. Over the next several years, the world market for this industry is expected to grow to more than $8 billion. Are 3D games just around the corner? What does this mean for the classic games like Tetris, Frogger and Pac-Man? Wouldn&#039;t we all like to know if this is a good time to get in on the action? These are some of the questions to be addressed by SofTECH&#039;s panel of experts. [Audio on IT Conversations]</description>

      <title>Malcolm Gladwell - Tech Nation</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail419.html</link>
      <description>Malcolm Gladwell is back on IT Conversations to discuss his new book, Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. Dr. Moira Gunn asks him, &quot;Do you really think there&#039;s a science of decision?&quot; We have two kinds of thought, Malcolm says. The first is the rational, deliberate and conscious thought that we analyze and cherish. The other is the kind of thinking that occurs below the level of awareness, and it doesn&#039;t happen slowly and deliberately, but really quickly. We tend to dismiss the latter in our society, but in the past few years psychologists have referred to this as the product of the adaptive unconscious. It&#039;s a kind of a big computer that does all the background tasks. It&#039;s powerful and fast, but because it&#039;s not part of our consciousness, it&#039;s rather mysterious.

      <description>Reality Games - The Next Revolution. 
&lt;p&gt;
Kuma Reality Games has gathered tremendous attention with KumaWar, an innovative PC game delivering accurate re-creations of actual events in the war just weeks after they occur -- and set off a storm of controversy. But behind its provocative subject matter is a challenge to traditional game publishers. The company&#039;s &#039;Episodic Games&#039; are building new content demand, new sources of revenue, and competitive distribution.
&lt;p&gt;
In this talk, Kuma CEO Keith Halper discusses the techniques and technology which make episodic games possible, their cultural and financial impact, and the process of introducing revolutionary change in the buzz-driven market for games.

      <description>The Gillmor Gang asks guest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bricklin.com&quot;&gt;Dan Bricklin&lt;/a&gt;, president of Software Garden, what innovations are on his radar. Dan&#039;s answers include the trend to large amounts of storage that allow a store-now-think-later approach, mobility, cheap CPU power and IP connectivity everywhere. We&#039;re seeing success from those who plan for, or at least enable unintended consequences. &quot;Google caught everyone by surprise,&quot; by using the population to generate the connection database, says Dan. The gang digs into the benefits of pervasive devices that can share with others and considers whether evolution shows us how markets work. Is there a technology ecosystem? And what&#039;s new in  interfaces? Google again. And Flash (and to some extent DHTML and JavaScript), which allow us to developed rich controls again.

Are these agile processes appropriate for your organization? If so, which should you consider adopting? What challenges can you expect and how can you overcome them? (Audio from IT Conversations.

      <title>The Gillmor Gang - January 28, 2005</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail414.html</link>
      <description>The Gillmor Gang on IT Conversations...
&lt;p&gt;
Steve calls in from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.integratedmedia.org/home.cfm&quot;&gt;Integrated Media Association&#039;s&lt;/a&gt; New Media Summit with his special guest, &lt;a href=&quot;http://console.timelessmedia.net/rel/history.html&quot;&gt;Stephen Hill&lt;/a&gt;. The talk is all about the convergence of radio (most notably public radio) and &quot;new media&quot; if that term even makes sense any longer. That convergence is due to digital technologies and the fact that it&#039;s now possible for nearly anyone to create broadcast-quality audio with a very small investment in equipment. Stephen reminds us that even FM radio isn&#039;t very old, having become popular in the mid 1960s, when broadcasters even supplied the receiver. (Hey...sounds like satellite today!)
&lt;p&gt;
Public radio in the U.S. has more than 20 million subscribers, but the public-radio insfrastructure has become a bottleneck in its own right. (Is NPR the &quot;Clear Channel of public radio?&quot;)
&lt;p&gt;
Is podcasting the next step for independently produced audio? It was an important topic at the New Media Summit. The consensus is that podcasting is still in Geeksville mode, but it&#039;s real close. What business model will prevail? Stephen thinks it&#039;s bundle-and-charge aggregation, and sees at least one segment of public radio going to a $240/year model.
&lt;p&gt;
But if there&#039;s an explosion of content, how will we sort our way through it? Will it be something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/attentionxml&quot;&gt;Attention.xml&lt;/a&gt;, or will we rely on more traditional systems like individual or group editors? An important development may be the Personal Service Publisher proposal (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.integratedmedia.org/files/Media/011305_663_0076969.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) presented at the conference.</description>

Blogs are simple and valuable, so why aren&#039;t they part of IBM or Micorosoft&#039;s plans for their collaborative-software products? (The Gillmor Gang on IT Conversations.)</description>

      <description>After Mark Cuban made a billion or so selling his company to Yahoo! during the height of the Web 1.0 craze, he decided to buy a basketball team. Fortunately, he bought the Mavericks, a team whose name suits his style: brash, out there, and unconventional. Now he&#039;s back in the media business with HDNet. Cuban is a stitch onstage, a straight-talking no-punches-pulled Wildman whose irreverent one liners will have you snorting wine out your nose. This conversation with Mark Cuban is moderated by John Heilemann, a special correspondent for Wired and a former staff writer for The New Yorker and The Economist.

      <description>John Doerr is one of the most prolific venture capitalists in the world, and one whose investments have been at the heart of the emerging Internet industry. His most recent -- and most spectacular -- success is Google, which Doerr backed in 1999 despite significant skepticism among other VCs. Asked at the time why he would back a search company with no proven business model, Doerr responded: &quot;With this kind of traffic, we&#039;ll figure it out.&quot; Seems they did. In conversation with journalist and author John Heilemann, who has been jousting onstage with Doerr for nearly a decade now. A not to be missed discussion.

      <title>The Gillmor Gang - January 14, 2005</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail405.html</link>
      <description>(The Gillmor Gang on IT Conversations) Adam Bosworth&lt;/a&gt;, now Google&#039;s VP of Engineering, joins The Gang this week to discuss his vision for the future of search architecture. &quot;How do you handle data that&#039;s much less known up front and where the query is by relevance?&quot; Adam asks. Most of today&#039;s databases are built on the relational model, but most of today&#039;s queries are not. Instead they&#039;re looking for keyword precision, location and semantic context -- not a textual or numeric match. The relational model is designed for use when both the data and the queries can be anticipated, but in today&#039;s world, neither are typically known in advance.
&lt;p&gt;
Adam suggests that the same divide-and-conquer architectures used to make web servers more scalable could be used in search. He envisions &lt;em&gt;data routers&lt;/em&gt; that will know which back-end servers have which knowledge and will query servers asynchronously according to the liklihood of getting the best results. 
&lt;p&gt;
The discussion then turns to the topic of attention and the technology and politics of knowing who&#039;s reading what on the Internet. XML-based RSS and Atom have created both the challenge and the opportunity.</description>

      <title>The Gillmor Gang - January 7, 2005</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail398.html</link>
      <description>(The Gillmor Gang on IT Conversations) It&#039;s CES week and The Gang is joined by guests Sam Whitmore and Robert Scoble. While the old-guard media talks about the latest gadgets premiering at CES, The Gang explores what&#039;s going on behind the scenes. Will Robert defend Bill Gate&#039;s &lt;em&gt;Communism&lt;/em&gt; remark? Is HP hedging its bets by supporting both Microsoft and Linux-based entertainment systems? What about the architecture: Will there be PCs in our living rooms, or will they just be entertainment peripherals? And will anyone buy this media-center stuff or is it really too expensive?
&lt;p&gt;
TiVo will take a hit as PVRs are built-into TVs. Doc reports that the FCC is well aware of what might happen and what restructuring of telcos and cable may be required when the demand side (people) become suppliers of programming. And there&#039;s a hint that cars could become open systems -- backplanes for multimedia and other devices.
&lt;p&gt;
Podcasting at CES? Not this year. Few seem to have even heard of it yet. (Are iPods and iTunes Apple&#039;s Roach Motel?) The Gang looks to the future and how distribution and syndication will change. Will BigMedia companies adapt? And how will the entertainment industry change when the demand side competes with the supply side for shelf space?</description>

      <title>The Gillmor Gang - December 31, 2004</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail394.html</link>
      <description>(The Gillmor Gang on IT Conversations) This week The Gang digs deeper into digital identity with a panel of experts. It begins as a &lt;em&gt;Kumbaya&lt;/em&gt; of identity vendors and technologies, but by the second half the gloves come off. Craig points out that everyone has built silos so far because there have been no alternatives. Is the idea of a Microsoft silo &quot;old fashioned thinking,&quot; as Kim suggests, defending the company he joined not all that long ago? He then presents the first five of his seven Laws of Identity -- clearly well thought out and vendor independent as all agree. Everyone also agrees that no identity solution can succeed without the cooperation and participation of Microsoft, but Dave is skeptical given the company&#039;s history in identity management. Phil points out that PKI hasn&#039;t succeded, and Kim suggests it&#039;s because PKI violated his 4th Law of Identity. And Doc suggests that digital identity needs a &#039;key personality&#039; in the same way as Dave has played a lead role in RSS and blogging. Make sure you listen to this one all the way through.</description>

      <description>(The Gillmor Gang on IT Conversations - audio) The Gang looks back on 2004 and forecasts the year to come. Guest Mitch Kertzman gives us his latest focus as a venture capitalist: the software-development process and software as a service and pay-for-use models. The Gillmor Gang looks at the recent flurry of BigCo M&amp;A activity, the commoditization of computing at various levels in the hardware/software stack, tech CEOs as bloggers, collaboration, and software reusability. And yes, there&#039;s a year-end look at podcasting.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail386.html</link>
      <description>Is open source ready for prime time? Can you bet your business on it? Open Source software is becoming a major issue in the evaluation of high tech and other companies. The questions about Open Source are moving past &quot;What is it?&quot; to &quot;How do we take it seriously in normal, long-term, business processes?&quot; In this panel discussion, an investment banker, a Red Hat executive, an intellectual property lawyer, and a software developer 
address the issue. [An audio presentation from IT Conversations.]</description>

      <title>David Bornstein - New Solutions</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail251.html</link>
      <description>David Bornstein talks about a project to bring electricity to poor people in Brazil: single wires going to houses, grounded in the soil, low voltages. The project is also bringing solar panels to rural areas, renting them for what people generally pay for candles, kerosene, etc. He also talks about &amp;quot;child line&amp;quot; in India, now in 55 cities. It&#039;s a number you can call if you see a child in distress. It started with one woman who spent 3 years trying to get the equivalent of an 800 number for it. It&#039;s deeply affected India&#039;s child protection policies. </description>

      <description>&quot;Less is More&quot; by Barry Schwartz, the Dorwin Cartwright Professor of Social Theory and Social Action in the Psychology Department at Swarthmore College, where he has taught since 1971. He is the author of ten books, among them &quot;The Battle for Human Nature,&quot; &quot;The Costs of Living,&quot; and in 2004, &quot;The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less.&quot; He is a fellow of both the American Psychological Association and the American Psychological Society. His research and teaching focus on the intersection of psychology and economics, and more specifically on how the abundance of choice in modern life both liberates and bedevils those who face it. </description>

      <description>(Audio: The Gillmor Gang on IT Conversations) With a preview of his forthcoming book from O&#039;Reilly Media, Phil Windley joins The Gang to share his insights on digital identity. The result is an excellent Digital Identity 101 by Professor Windley. Phil explains the differences between virtual directories, metadirectories, centralized directories and federated identity. Other topics include Shibboleth, role-based authentication, SAML, the Liberty Alliance, and SXIP. Also, what&#039;s the potential role of DNS in identity management, who controls identity (users or vendors), and who will be the winners and losers in the identity-management game?</description>

      <description>(The Gillmor Gang on IT Conversations - audio) The Gang digs into SAP this week with guest Shai Agassi, SAP executive board member. SAP has a reputation of being less than fully open, and Shai makes the case for the company&#039;s new architecture, a single-box solution with integrated application server and applications. The discussion covers the commoditization of applications versus interfaces via web services, grid computing, SAP for mid-sized businesses, and Oracle&#039;s attempted takeover of PeopleSoft. And don&#039;t miss The Gang&#039;s wrap-up after Shai leaves.</description>

      <description>It&#039;s all about Gmail. From WebTalk Radio, an audio interview by Rob Greenlee with Georges, Google&#039;s Director of Googlettes. Gmail may only be a beta-test program, but already the pundits are speculating that it could break another leg from the Microsoft desktop stool. Georges explains the magic behind Gmail: It just works. Gmail uses search rather than rely on folders to manage archives. Its conversation view was inspired by IM, and it&#039;s clearly a masterpiece of JavaScript programming. New features include a better address book, POP3 support, forwarding, and a desktop nofier utility. Possiblities for the future include support for HTML email and third-party POP3 accounts. </description>

      <title>The Gillmor Gang - December 6, 2004</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail346.html</link>
      <description>The Gillmor Gang on IT Conversations: Happy Birthday Lotus Notes! You&#039;re twenty year old today. Well, 20 years from announcement and 15 from the launch of Release 1. In any case, Lotus Notes has left a permanent mark on the history of collaboration software. On this special occasion, The Gang is joined by Notes creator Ray Ozzie (who went on to found Groove Networks in October 1997) and a member of the early Notes team, Peter O&#039;Kelly, now an analyst with Burton Group.
&lt;p&gt;
Lotus Notes was arguably the first groupware product, and Ray explains why the company had such a difficult time explaining what it was. That tide turned when Notes was adopted by VARs who created the vertical applications that have made the product so successful. To this day Notes is respected for its rapid-application development (RAD) architecture and its ability to just deploy the prototype.
&lt;p&gt;
The discussion goes well beyond Lotus Notes, as Ray and Peter give their big-picture perspectives on collaboration, client/server architectures, and the bifurcation of technology adoption: the difference between deployment within and outside the enterprise. </description>

His mission: to retrace the most extraordinary journey of all time, a journey that involves every man, woman and child alive today.  By collecting blood samples from thousands of men living in isolated tribes around the world and analyzing their DNA, Spencer and his colleagues discovered that all humans alive today can be traced back to a small tribe of hunter-gatherers who lived in Africa 60,000 years ago. </description>

At Digital Identity World 2004, Scott Mace talked with Davis about the goals of the Identity Commons, including creating a spam-free mailbox on the Internet; why Identity Commons is a better solution than registering with a social network; how Identity Commons grew out of the OASIS XRI standard; how early revenues are funding the open source aspect of Identity Commons; allowing individuals to express their own privacy preferences via iBrokers; building on the work of P3P; the role of XDI.org; plans to interoperate with SXIP; and how Identity Commons is organized.

      <title>Dick Hardt - SXIP</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail294.html</link>
      <description>Dick Hardt is founder and CEO of Sxip Networks, developers of SXIP, the Simple eXtensible Identity Protocol. At Digital Identity World 2004, Scott Mace talked with Hardt about why SXIP decided to build its own federated identity system, rather than go with the SAML-based Liberty Allliance; why the mechanism of separating asserting ones&#039; identity from the authentication mechanism is the path to true digital identities on the Web; how Slashdot karma could be an alternative currency; transferring reputations from one social network to another; where SXIP and Identity Commons complement each other, and where they compete; privacy considerations when using SAML and SXIP; and why technology such as SXIP may shape future privacy legislation.

      <description>On his latest expedition in February 2004, Ben Saunders set out from Cape Arktichevsky in Northern Siberia in an attempt to be the first person in the world to make a complete crossing of the frozen Arctic Ocean in a 1,240-mile journey ending in Canada, solo and unsupported. The expedition was a traumatic one: out of the four solo attempts, Ben was the only one to reach the North Pole. </description>

      <title>Overload - Bloggercon III</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail278.html</link>
      <description>A day is coming when Robert will have 10,000 feeds instead of the 915 he&#039;s currently reading. (He guesses the average blog reader follows 50 to 100 feeds, based on anecdotal evidence of talking with other bloggers). In fact, the number of bloggers he reads is much higher than 915 thanks to group blogs and services like Feedster, Pubsub, and Technorati. Robert Scoble leads the &lt;em&gt;Overload&lt;/em&gt; session at Bloggercon III.</description>

      <title>The Gillmor Gang - November 12, 2004</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail290.html</link>
      <description>(The Gillmor Gang on IT Conversations)
&lt;p&gt;
This week The Gang starts off wondering about Chris Stone&#039;s departure from Novell, which he was steering back towards the Linux market. And what about Sun? Are they serious about Linux on the desktop, or is that just a poker chip, a placemark for their real move into software-as-service?
&lt;p&gt;
Speaking of software-as-service, The Gang dives head-first into Google.  Jon says Gmail is &quot;seductively powerful,&quot; but is Google on the path to becoming The Borg? Will we have to turn to turn to (gasp) Microsoft to save us? Or will Google continue to be our best buddy? 
&lt;p&gt;
The show concludes with a discussion of podcasting: its potential business models and its ultimate effect on Big Media.
&lt;p&gt;
Michael Vizard, editor-in-chief of CRN Magazine, joins The Gang 
this week.</description>

      <description>Audio from &quot;The Importance of the Law and IT&quot; series on IT Conversations: Games aren&#039;t just for gamers any more. The legal issues surrounding intellectual property in virtual worlds has implications beyond GameBoys and PlayStations. What&#039;s the relationship between real and virtual-world economies? What can these virtual worlds teach us about democracy? Will regulation leak into (or out of) virtual worlds? Who owns avatars avatars and game scenarios in Internet-based games?
&lt;p&gt;
These are among the topics discussed at The State of Play, an annual conference sponsored by the Institute for Law &amp; Policy at New York Law School and the Information Society Project at Yale Law School. Ernest Miller interviews two of the conference&#039;s organizers.</description>

      <title>Frans de Waal - Human Nature</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail231.html</link>
      <description>Frans de Waal tries to convince us that we&#039;re all apes and that there&#039;s little difference between us except that we walk on two legs. At first you think he&#039;s joking. Perhaps not. He thinks that if we ignore the importance of power struggles in the study of human nature, we&#039;re making a big mistake. In his talk, he draws constant parallels between primate and human behavior and uses politicians as examples, including visuals of where aggression can also be used for reconciliation and how it plays a positive role, not just in politics, but in business and our social lives. 
&lt;p&gt;
Frans de Waal, a comparative primatologist, is best known for his work on the social intelligence of primates, which he uses to explain human interactions. In this presentation, he considers the sociology of reconciliation, reciprocity and fairness including examples from American presidential politics and campaigns.

What&#039;s driving this? He goes into great depth on Moore&#039;s Law and later on, Metcalfe&#039;s Law, which he received brownie points from Bob at the end of his session. He talks about technologies, how they are now aimed inward and gives a number of S curve examples. </description>

      <description>(The Gillmor Gang on IT Conversations). Steve and The Gang may be suffering from post-election traumatic-stress syndrome. They consider the effect of the election on technology and vice versa. Reviewing a clip from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail238.html&quot;&gt;presentation by Thomas Barnett&lt;/a&gt;, they ask: Is keeping the peace really a system-administraton problem? The U.S. is clearly divided, even polarized. But is it dynamically stable or will it soon tip in one direction or another? And what is the effect of information (including blogging) on the country and the election process? Is there too much data for most people to absorb and understand?</description>

      <title>Knock-Off Printer Cartridges - The Law and IT</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail261.html</link>
      <description>Knock-Off Printer Cartridges (Lexmark v. Static Control). Lexmark, the printer manufacturer, attempted to use copyright law and
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to prevent companies like Static
Control Components from making compatible toner cartridges or
refilling used cartridges. A
district court agreed with Lexmark, which would mean that nearly any
company that made replacement devices, such as oil filters for cars,
could very easily be sued under copyright law. Luckily, the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals has rejected those arguments. This case is loaded with implications for virtually all IT professionals. [&quot;The Importance of Law and IT&quot; with Ernest Miller on IT Conversations.]</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail249.html</link>
      <description>&quot;Connected politics is not cesessarily left-wing politics...Taking power away from the political elites, the media elites and the rest of the elites and handing it to the great American public will not necessarily shift politics in the country to the left.&quot;

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail241.html</link>
      <description>Biomimicry: It&#039;s the conscious emulation of life&#039;s genius. Janine Benyus is a life sciences writer and author of six books, including her latest -- Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature. In Biomimicry, she names an emerging science that seeks sustainable solutions by mimicking nature&#039;s designs and processes (e.g., solar cells that mimic leaves, agriculture that looks like a prairie, business that runs like a redwood forest).

We need 4.5 planet Earths just to meet the current consumption of resources, and it&#039;s only getting worse. But there&#039;s hope, and Alex gives his favorite examples of cool ideas of innovation, particularly in the developing world. It&#039;s amazing what necessity can breed.

      <title>Bnetd v. Blizzard - Law and IT</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail259.html</link>
      <description>A group of open source programmers reverse engineered Blizzard&#039;s Battle.net by analyzing the packets the player copies of the game shared with Blizzard&#039;s servers. Their work resulted in the bnetd project, which let anyone run their own Battle.net-like service. Blizzard sued, of course, and the district court found the open source programmers guilty of violating the End User License Agreement (EULA) as well as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. What does this mean for open-source programmers, technologists and consumers? [Ernest Miller&#039;s &lt;em&gt;Law and IT&lt;/em&gt; series on IT Converations.]</description>

      <title>Thomas Barnett - Emerging Worldviews</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail238.html</link>
      <description>Pop!Tech was about much more than just technology, and the agenda didn&#039;t skirt controversy. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thomaspmbarnett.com/weblog/&quot;&gt;Thomas Barnett&lt;/a&gt; calls globalization &quot;this country&#039;s gift to history&quot; and explains why its wide dissemination is critical to the security of not only America but the entire world. As a senior military analyst for the U.S. Naval War College, Barnett is intimately familiar with the culture of the Pentagon and the State Department (both of which he believes are due for significant overhauls). He explains how the Pentagon, still in shock at the rapid dissolution of the once evil empire, spent the 1990s grasping for a long-term strategy to replace containment. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Barnett argues, revealed the gap between an outdated Cold War-era military and a radically different one needed to deal with emerging threats. </description>

      <title>Malcolm Gladwell - Human Nature</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail230.html</link>
      <description>IT Conversations audio from Pop!Tech 2004 (Human Nature): Author and New Yorker Magazine journalist Malcolm Gladwell&#039;s &lt;em&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/em&gt; has been a tremendous bestseller for over three years and counting. In this presentation he explores why we can&#039;t trust people&#039;s opinions -- because we don&#039;t have the language to express our feelings. His examples include the story of New Coke and how Coke&#039;s market research misled them, and the development of Herman-Miller&#039;s Aeron chair, the best-selling chair in the history of office chairs, which succeeded in spite of research that suggested it would fail.</description>

      <title>The Gillmor Gang - October 22, 2004</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail244.html</link>
      <description>The extended Gang dives deep into podcasting this week with Dave Winer, Adam Curry and three of the four members of the Firesign Theatre: David Ossman, Philip Proctor and Peter Bergman. Adam and Dave give the history (all eight weeks of it) and the raison d&#039;etre of podcasting, and Steve suggests it&#039;s similar to the early days of pirate radio. Is podcasting just a flash in the pan, or a major challenge to big-business radio? Will the impact be similar to that of blogs or something altogether different? What are the implications of Howard Stern moving to satellite, and will legislation like the INDUCE Act inhibit freedom of speech in the exploding podcasting phenomenon? By the end of the show, the Firesign guests not only get it, they&#039;re guzzling the Cool-Aid.</description>

      <title>Adam Curry - Behind the Mic</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail225.html</link>
      <description>Doug Kaye interviews Adam Curry: His first gig was on a Dutch in-hospital radio station, then as John Holden a motorcycle-riding African-American pirate-radio DJ. Most of us met Adam as an early MTV host, but he actually got his start as a budding geek. In this interview with IT Conversations&#039; host Doug Kaye, you&#039;ll hear a very personal side of Adam&#039;s life: how he discovered the Internet and the web, registering the mtv.com domain, then being sued over it. He founded OnRamp, an early web-development company that grew through M&amp;A to a $230 million public company. Adam has started many other ventures, not all successful. He&#039;s been to Iraq and even produced a reality-TV show about his own family. Doug and Adam also discuss audio on the &#039;net. Here&#039;s your chance to hear the Behind the Mic side of the creator of iPodder and one of podcastings leading evangelists.</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail226.html</link>
      <description>The Gillmor Gang: Google Desktop Search is this week&#039;s hot topic even though Doc isn&#039;t happy that it&#039;s not available on either Mac or Linux. No doubt it&#039;s a powerful personal tool, but what does it mean for IT departments? If it sneaks in at the desktop level, what about security and privacy? For that matter, what does it mean that &quot;the application sends non-personal information about things like the application&#039;s performance and reliability to Google?&quot;
&lt;p&gt;
Does Microsoft continue to have a blindspot for search? There were rumors of a pending Google browser. Is this even better for the company and for us? What&#039;s the commercial value for Google, and will Yahoo! follow suit? Finally, is GDS just a platform for additional services?
&lt;p&gt;
All of this plus the podcasting phenomenon on another chock-full edition of The Gillmor Gang. This week&#039;s special guests are Scott MacGregor (Mozilla Thunderbird architect) and  Brendan Eich (chief architect) of the Mozilla Foundation. </description>

      <title>The Future of Security - Gnomedex 4.0</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail216.html</link>
      <description>From Gnomedex 4.0: A panel of experts explores the future of IT security. Are hardware methods superior to software? How do memory-managed languages help? How can we make security management within the skill set of the average user? Is automation the answer? Should upgrades be mandated? Should there be a &lt;em&gt;security tax&lt;/em&gt; for those who don&#039;t upgrade their systems. DRM: Does it increase security risks? And what attacks should we expect in the future?</description>

      <description>Recorded live at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnomedex.com&quot;&gt;Gnomedex 4.0&lt;/a&gt;, the Gang digs into audioblogging and podcasting. What&#039;s it all about? Is it a fad, a future trend, or here today and to stay? And what about the state of RSS? Is there too much content, a glut of information?</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail210.html</link>
      <description>RFID -- Radio Frequency Identification -- is transforming the way companies track inventory, artwork and even law briefs, but some fear it could be used for more &quot;Orwellian&quot; pursuits. A panel of leading technology developers and pioneer end-user corporations explores this promising and yet maligned emerging technology that both empowers consumers and raises privacy issues. &lt;p&gt;

      <title>The Gillmor Gang - September 24, 2004</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail206.html</link>
      <description>This week The Gillmor Gang tackles a little bit of everything. Sun announced CPU time on demand, but where&#039;s the real opportunity? Is it for loosely coupled systems? For remotely hosted on-demand Windows? Technology is advancing fastest for consumers and SMBs, so is that the best place to try new ideas? The iPod platform is suddenly taking off including RSS integration. Does this portend something for the enterprise?

Joining The Gang this week are Scott Rafer, president and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedster.com&quot;&gt;Feedster&lt;/a&gt;, and Stephen Shankland, senior staff writer at &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.com.com/&quot;&gt;CNET News.com&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

      <description>The INDUCE Act 2.0 [The Law and IT]: The Inducing Infringements of Copyright Act of 2004, commonly called the INDUCE Act, is a bill before the Senate that is ostensibly meant to make it easier for the copyright industry to sue the distributors of technology that can be used for filesharing. Those who distribute certain technologies or devices could be found guilty for the copyright violations of their users. It is difficult to overestimate the effect this legislation would have on the IT industry. This show discusses the original bill as well as various alternatives, including the version provided by the Copyright Office. [IT Conversations]</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groove.net/index.cfm?pagename=RayOzzie&quot;&gt;Ray Ozzie&lt;/a&gt; is the guest on the latest edition of The Gillmor Gang. The lead developer of Notes and the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groove.net&quot;&gt;Groove Networks&lt;/a&gt; joins The Gang to look at big-picture issues. Innovation no longer flows from IT out, but from the consumer world to IT, and most innovation and growth is at the edge of the network. iPods are caches for iTunes on the desktops, which are in turn caches for the iTunes store. What does the future hold for VoIP and Skype, and what do the recent Longhorn announcements mean for ISVs? CRN&#039;s Michael Vizard returns as a Gang member.</description>

      <title>Garage Doors and the DMCA - Law and IT</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail201.html</link>
      <description>Chamberlain v. Skylink (The Law and IT on IT Conversations): Garage Doors and the DMCA. On August 31st, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals issued what was the second appellate ruling dealing with the anti-circumvention
provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The court determined that the universal garage door opener remotes made by Skylink Technologies did not violate the DMCA by illicitly accessing the software in the Chamberlain Group&#039;s garage door openers. Basically, the court said it was okay to sell garage door remotes that worked with any brand of garage door. It may sound absurd, but the case is a landmark decision regarding technological innovation and interoperability.</description>

      <description>Apple v. Real v. Microsoft (IT Conversations series, &quot;The Importance of Law and IT&quot;): The online music store marketplace is seeing intense competition between companies such as Apple, Real Networks, and Microsoft. Real has tried to make music downloaded from its store playable on the
iPod, actions which Apple has called the &quot;tactics and ethics of a hacker.&quot; What are the legal issues with what Real had done? What is this competition all about? Ernest Miller discusses these questions with leading legal and business analysts.</description>

      <description>Steve Gillmor and Technorati&#039;s David L. Sifry have been working on something called &lt;a class=&quot;featurelink&quot; href=&quot;http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/attentionxml&quot;&gt;Attention.xml&lt;/a&gt; for nearly a year, and this week they discuss the concept with the rest of The 
  Gang. What is it? It&#039;s a specification for tracking, prioritizing and sharing 
  what people are reading, looking at or listenting to in RSS and elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Disruptive Wireless - Panel</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail184.html</link>
      <description>A Supernova 2004 Panel: Wireless connectivity will be the backbone of the emerging pervasive Internet. New technologies, unleashed by new regulatory approaches, promise an explosion of wireless communications capacity unlike anything seen before. Disruptive innovations range from low-power ad hoc sensor nets to ultra-wideband video streaming links to metropolitan-area data networks. How real are these scenarios, and what roadblocks stand in their way? Are unlicensed technologies such as WiFi and WiMax a threat to the 3G vision of wireless operators, or the mobile industry&#039;s true future? Will software radio and other edge innovations shift the balance of power in the wireless world? </description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail185.html</link>
      <description>A Panel Discussion from Supernova 2004: Policy developments in areas such as broadband deployment, content regulation, intellectual property, Internet taxation, telecom regulation, privacy, and outsourcing have significant impacts on innovation. The tech industry complains that it just wants government off its back except when it wants help, subsidies, or other changes in the law. Beyond the usual political rhetoric, what is the right way to think about technology policy? How will the business and technical trend toward decentralization affect both the participants and the substance of these debates? </description>

      <description>A Panel from Supernova 2004: There are now more than 25 million high-speed Internet subscribers in the US. Millions of customers in Asia enjoy broadband connections at 10 megabits or greater. Yet the promise of the broadband home as a networked hub for compelling media and computing experiences remains elusive. What are the killer applications, devices, standards, and interfaces that will make broadband more than just a faster way to surf the Web? And once it arrives, how will the broadband home shift industry dynamics and user behavior? </description>

      <title>Telecom Transformation - Panel</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail182.html</link>
      <description>From Supernova 2004: The trillion-dollar telecommunications industry is being transformed. The shift from voice-specific networks to applications on top of broadband data networks will upset industry economics, create huge new business opportunities, and confound regulatory structures. Below the waterline lie issues of addressing, standards, and interconnection. On the surface, new applications will be even more significant than cheaper pricing for plain old telephony. But what are those applications? What role will carriers, equipment manufacturers, and end-users play in defining them? And will the new telecom industry be too competitive and too innovative for its own (economic) good? </description>

      <description>The Gillmor Gang, August 8, 2004. Some of the Gang members report from Linux World. (Doc says it&#039;s too much about what the vendors are doing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itconversations.com/clip.php?showid=179&amp;start=4:00&amp;stop=4:17&quot;&gt;[clip]&lt;/a&gt;.) Our guests from RealNetworks discuss their plans to open source components 
of their Helix line of products. They&#039;re using two licenses: GPL 
for open source and a commercial license for manufacturers who can&#039;t 
be bound by the GPL. Jon Udell continues to explain the need for random-access players and supporting URLs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itconversations.com/clip.php?showid=179&amp;start=35:23&amp;stop=36:17&quot;&gt;[clip]&lt;/a&gt; 
and standards and why he thinks players will ultimately become authoring 
tools. Dana Gardner weighs in on why multimedia has yet to catch on in the corporate world. </description>

      <title>Alistair Cockburn - Agile Software Development</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail175.html</link>
      <description>Alistair Cockburn had been a hardware designer and researcher for 16 years when IBM asked him to write a methodology for object-oriented projects. He&#039;s spent the last decade studying and writing about software development and learned that some of the most successful projects have the simplest processes. In 2001 he and 16 other software-development heavyweights met to discuss so-called lightweight methodologies, and one result was the Agile Software Development Manifesto. In this insightful interview with IT Conversations&#039; producer Doug Kaye, Alistair explains how he uses games as a model for software projects, and how he discovered that the term &quot;software engineering&quot; was created on a whim in 1968. He also discusses the American and European aversion to copying: the not-invented-here (NIH) syndrome. [Audio and transcript available]</description>

      <description>Novell used to be &quot;The NetWare Company.&quot; Today, Novell is one of the most dynamic open source advocates and drivers on the planet. How did Novell manage this transformation and, more importantly, what is Novell doing to manage competing forces on the desktop (KDE vs. Gnome), foster open source innovation (OpenOffice, Mono, etc.), and generally push open source to the next level of adoption? In this keynote, the architect of Novell&#039;s open source strategy details the company&#039;s vision for open source on the desktop and server, and what it is doing to bring that vision to fruition. </description>

      <title>Milton Ngan - Life After LOTR</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail174.html</link>
      <description>Milton Ngan, Digital Operations Manager, Weta Digital Ltd.
&lt;p&gt;
Having spent the last six years overcoming challenge after challenge producing LOTR (Lord of the Rings), it has become apparent that there are other things than this project. We have accumulated a significant legacy of software and hardware technology during this journey. Now that we have reached our destination, there are new roads to travel. We have a unique opportunity to shed the dead weight and re-sharpen our tools based upon the lessons we have learned. At this crossroad, we also have a number of choices to make, Linux, OS X, or Windows? The choices are not easy for technical, political, and religious reasons. After experiencing the freedom and frustration with a predominantly open source platform, this is a troubling decision, especially when open source platforms are not looking so cost effective anymore. The show must go on, and it will. </description>

      <title>The Dysons - In Praise of Open Thinking</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail170.html</link>
      <description>One of the characteristics of diversity--in science, in technology, in biology, in culture, in software, or in children--is that the underlying programming tends to be open source, or connected in all directions. Freeman Dyson and George Dyson think in all directions, but each filters through a particular lens. Esther Dyson, also scheduled, was stuck in Texas and couldn&#039;t be there.</description>

      <title>Bdale Garbee - Beyond Doing Business</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail171.html</link>
      <description>Starting with some of the key decisions in Debian project history that enabled success, Garbee applies his unique experience to explore how communities of developers and users working together accomplish amazing things. His examples range from building amateur satellites and breaking the SPECfp2000 record, to improving the technology literacy of hundreds of thousands of students and ordinary citizens in Spain and beyond. </description>

      <title>The Gillmor Gang - July 29, 2004</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail172.html</link>
      <description>Dave Winer has had a huge impact on the Internet as we know it. Blogging and RSS? They might not exist if it weren&#039;t for Dave. Live from the Democratic National Convention, Dave joined The Gillmor Gang to discuss &lt;a class=&quot;featurelink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.conventionbloggers.com&quot;&gt;ConventionBloggers.com&lt;/a&gt; and the reaction it has received from the traditional press who have no idea what&#039;s under the covers. Dave says the DNC is &quot;truly visionary&quot; and have accepted this &quot;technology transplant&quot; but they probably don&#039;t realize what they&#039;ve done. This could be the the turning point for RSS--when it becomes just another part of the infrastructure.
&lt;p&gt;
Where will blogging and RSS go? Deeper into local politics? Are RSS and the web as powereful as talk radio on a 50,000-watt AM station? Dave and The Gang also debate the importance and future of audio blogging and the need to link to or excerpt multimedia content. It&#039;s one thing to download a one-hour show to an iPod, but when you can blog a sound bite as easily as you can a text byte, then look for a boom. You&#039;ll hear this and much more in another great edition of The Gillmor Gang.</description>

      <description>The most important things to pay attention to aren&#039;t always the most obvious. In his keynote presentation from the O&#039;Reilly Open Source Convention, Tim O&#039;Reilly takes a look at some of the deep trends underlying open source, and some of the cool projects and ideas that are keeping folks at O&#039;Reilly up at night. He also presents some results from O&#039;Reilly&#039;s recent market research efforts, combining information from book sales patterns with other indications of technology adoption and interest patterns. </description>

      <description>In his keynote presentation from the O&#039;Reilly Open Source Convention, Robert Lefkowitz says, &quot;Open source doesn&#039;t just mean access to the source code.&quot;  So begins the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php&quot;&gt;Open Source Definition&lt;/a&gt;.  What then, does access to the source code mean?  Seen through the lens of an Enterprise user, what does open source mean?  When is (or isn&#039;t) it significant?  And a catalogue of open source related arbitrage opportunities.</description>

      <description>Our special guest, Dave Sifry, founder and CEO of Technorati,  will be providing real-time analysis of the political blogosphere for CNN at next week&#039;s Democratic National Convention. Dave discusses this announcement and gives us his social and technical insights into Technorati: &quot;tracking patterns of influence and authority in real time.&quot; 140+ servers give Technorati a huge grid-computing system, and Dave explains how their technology is different from traditional search engines. On open-source software, &quot;We wouldn&#039;t exist without it.&quot; He even goes deep into the Postgres/MySQL debate.</description>

      <description>Is this the start of Browser War II? Can Mozilla-based browsers corner 6% of the market by year end? And if they do, will they be targeted by the same crackers who go after IE flaws? Does the potential for &quot;tag soup&quot; sound like what Microsoft did to the browser market in 1996? This week&#039;s special guest is Brendan Eich, chief architect, Mozilla Foundation.</description>

      <description>Special guest: Jonathan Schwartz (Sun) and guest Gang member, Michael Vizard (CRN Magazine). Solaris goes open source. Is Sun the low-cost provider because their oeprating system cost-of-goods sold are essentially zero? Will IBM buy Novell to acquire SUSE Linux?. Will Schwartz succeed in prioritizing its sales (and compensating its staff) according to the NPV of products and services? Will Wall Street let him do it? The Gang assesses the futures of Sun and its new president.</description>

      <title>Jonathan Schwartz - Perspective</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail159.html</link>
      <description>Decentralization is key to Sun&#039;s success. (Remember &quot;The network is the computer?&quot;) And, no surprise, it&#039;s not all about the desktop. 100 million desktops were sold last year, but one billion wireless devices, and Jonathan says that market is all about Java. In this keynote from Supernova 2004, Jonathan also discusses &quot;free&quot; software. Linux? It&#039;s not free when Red Hat is $2,000 per server, he says. (If you missed it, Sun announced plans to open-source Solaris.) 
&lt;p&gt;
Read or listen to this keynote from our Supernova 2004 series. And don&#039;t miss the lively Q&amp;A with questions from Marc Canter, Chris Allen, Amy Wohl, and Bob Frankston. </description>

      <title>Exploding the Enterprise - Panel</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail166.html</link>
      <description>Business is increasingly distributed. We work in shifting teams separated by organization boundaries and geography, in organizations increasingly dependent on independent contractors, telecommuters, and outsourcers. How can technology help rather than hinder those processes? Will the grand visions of Web services and federated digital identity become realities? Can any vendor make money in an increasingly standards-based, commoditized marketplace? And what happens to the people involved as centralized organizations are blown apart? </description>

      <description>As the creator of Notes and Groove, Ray has been changing work through communications tools for 20 years. In this presentation recorded at &lt;a class=&quot;featurelink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.itconversations.com/series/supernova2004.html&quot;&gt;Supernova 2004&lt;/a&gt;, Ray discusses recent experience using Groove in a truly distributed enviornment: support of humanitarian operations in Iraq. Think of it: There&#039;s no IT department, no Xerox machines, everything must be secure, and oh yeah...people may be shooting at you. The inside-the-beltway folks are thinking centralization: servers, but they&#039;re not addressing the social-software realities of how people work and how they form ad-hoc relationships.</description>

      <description>Humans are inherently social, but computers have traditionally been solitary beasts. No more. Yet ten years into the Internet era, with wireless connectivity and broadband links sprouting up everywhere, we&#039;re just starting to grapple with the forms and practices of social software. Weblogs, social networking tools, and cameraphones are manifestations of a people-centric digital ecosystem. How should the tools evolve to take into account the subtleties of human social behavior? Can they survive as businesses? And what about the unintended consequences, like spam, when people and large-scale networks intersect?</description>

      <description>Syndication feeds using formats such as RSS and Atom allow users to aggregate and manipulate information from many sources. They are a staple of the Weblog world and are increasingly conquering Web content. But is there more to syndication than reading 300 blogs at once? The growing number of entrepreneurs and investors working on syndication-based tools seem to think so. Where is syndication going, and what are the missing pieces for it to get there? Is syndication a shortcut to the Semantic Web, the vision of adding rich structure to the mass of information online? </description>

      <title>The Gillmor Gang - June 4, 2004</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail148.html</link>
      <description>Guest: Michael Vizard, editor-in-chief, CRN Magazine
&lt;p&gt;
CA&#039;s CEO resigns. Sun announces open-source Solaris. As the PC becomes more powerful, will desktops become servers? Is the middleware market as we&#039;ve know it dying due to open source (JBoss)? Does IBM just talk the open-source talk? How are vendors creating their open-source strategies?Are applications and services the only remaining battlegrounds? Trends follow the talent, so where is the talent going? Globalization? The Gillmor Gang plays Vendor Sports: Who will win? Who will become the JetBlue of IT services?</description>

      <description>Not only has the company carved out a leading position in the nascent niche of blogging tools, its founders, Ben and Mena Trott, have aquired personal reputations among their customers and critics alike. Prior to version 3.0, Movable Type was donation-ware and the average contribution was only US$0.38. Now they&#039;re dealing with the controversy surrounding TypeKey, their hosted identity service for weblog comments. Hasn&#039;t Microsoft tried the same thing with Passport? Hear why Ben and Mena think TypeKey is different.</description>

      <description>During the 1990s, Phil was the target of a three-year criminal investigation because the US Federal Government held that export restrictions for cryptographic software were violated when his invention, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), spread all around the world following its publication as freeware.  Despite a lack of funding, a staff, or even a company to stand behind him, and despite government persecution, PGP nonetheless, became the most widely used e-mail encryption software in the world. </description>

      <description>Lessig sketches the boundaries of protection that intellectual property law should set on code, but argues that extremism is now defeating these limits, just as perpetual copyright has in the media world. The consequence is an environment within which modular creativity is increasingly constrained.</description>

               and IT Conversations&#039; first-ever live sporting event! 
               With virtually no advance notice more than 250 listeners 
               learned about us over the course of the day through 
               word-of-mouth and a few blogs. Some sent email from 
               as far away as Germany and Latvia.</description>

      <title>William H. Janeway - Alternative Venture Models</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail70.html</link>
      <description>As has been the case with every transformational wave of fundamental technological innnovation since the Canals, the short-term greed of the Internet Bubble financed a Darwinian explosion of exercises in building out the necessary infrastructure and of experiments in finding commercial uses for it. When the bubble inevitably collapsed, it left behind two sets of road maps: at the application level, the business models that worked, such as Ebay and Yahoo! and Amazon; at the infrastructure level, a set of challenging technological requirements needed to deliver a distributed computing and communications environment as scalable and secure as it is robust and easy to manage. </description>

Many respected computer scientists don&#039;t think it can be done at all. </description>

      <description>How do we ensure that the &quot;Second Superpower&quot; Jim Moore proposes includes the poor as well as the rich? When a new democratic structure emerges from highly-wired westerners, how do we ensure it&#039;s fair and just for those currently unwired?</description>

Eben suggests, &quot;SCO&#039;s job here was to raise its stock price and merely having a contract and trade secret lawsuit against IBM was not likely to raise its stock price much.&quot; Hence SCO&#039;s demands that Linux users pay SCO a license fee.

      <description>Andre explains his vision for how real-world federated identity will be deployed. His for-profit Ping Identity Corporation develops the software, which it then makes available using an open-source model from SourceID.org. The company also manages the shared network infrastrcture of PingID, which is the membership-driven entity that solves the scalability problem of the legal issues (managing the number of relationships that otherwise increases at an n-squared rate).

      <description>Phil explains the difference between &quot;identity management&quot; and &quot;management by identity&quot; and how digital ID has moved beyond rudimentary single sign-on (SSO) into federation across administrative and corporate boundaries. Topics in this interview include the Liberty Alliance, SAML, privacy regulation, the role of digital ID in security, and the identity of &quot;things,&quot; not just people. Phil also looks to the future, discussing the role of trust (&quot;it can&#039;t be built, manufactured, or bought&quot;), and standards (&quot;we&#039;re compressing a four- to six-year process into three years&quot;). </description>

      <description>Mark provides an in-depth introduction to Radio Frequency ID tags--the hottest, new, but 50 year-old technology. Why has it taken so long? Mark says it&#039;s been the high cost and lack of standards. In this interview we dig into the privacy concerns that have been raised regarding RFID usage, and look at some of the more unusual successful RFID deployments such as how the Scottish Courage brewery tagged its kegs and thereby saved US$14 million--enough to fund the acquisition of another brewery.</description>

      <description>Tim says the operating system no longer matters--no more than the browser or the CPU matters. Applications now live above the level of a single device or operating system. The &quot;paradigm failure&quot; is that people don&#039;t understand the importance of sites like Amazon.com, eBay, and Google, because they are so locked into the PC application model.</description>

Because of a flaw in current trends in CIO incentive structures, CIOs and IT mangers, he says, are expected to &quot;avoid risk, and keep things running.&quot; John also responds to Nick Carr&#039;s &quot;IT Doesn&#039;t Matter&quot; article earlier this year in Harvard Business Review. John says the article &quot;plays to the mood of the executive suite today. It reinforces all their worst instincts.&quot;</description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail28.html</link>
      <description>Imagine being able to send encrypted email to anyone using only their email address as a public key. No need to obtain and verify a public key in advance. PKI has failed as an email-encryption tool. Only a few of us use PGP. IBE could change all that. Founder Dan Boneh and CEO Sathvik Krishnamurthy are interviewed.</description>

      <title>Cory Doctorow - The DMCA and IT</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail18.html</link>
      <description>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes reverse engineering illegal in the U.S., and that&#039;s a bad thing for IT. Do recent changes in copyright law mean we need to police our employees for infringement? How about our customers? Are you responsible for traffic from anonymous users on your WiFi LANs? And what about those new data-retention regulations? (What&#039;s a CIO to do?) </description>

They track over 42,000,000 web servers, and analyze and publish their data. When a site moves to a new hosting service, Netcraft knows! Who&#039;s moving where? What about those C&amp;W/Exodus customers? Why are sites leaving the U.S.? Who are the winners and losers in the hosting business? (Who&#039;s stealing customers, and from whom?)</description>

      <title>Phil Wainewright - Web-Service ASPs</title>
      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail22.html</link>
      <description>How is this new breed of online outsources (such as Salesforce.com) different from the old ASPs? Who should outsource and what applications should they outsource? What can we learn from the PeopleSoft/Oracle/J.D. Edwards situation? Phil explains his concept of &quot;pluggable automation,&quot; to what extent it&#039;s realistic today, how to select and manage ASPs, and why online outsourcing is better than casual sex. Phil has posted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.looselycoupled.com/opinion/2003/wainew-asp-ws0722.html&quot;&gt;partial transcript&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>Is security for web services really all that different from security in other contexts? The author of Web Services Security tells it like it is. Which standards are fully cooked, and which should you avoid? What kinds of attacks will web services be vulnerable to? Are application/XML firewalls the answer? </description>

      <link>http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail33.html</link>
      <description>Pioneers First Virtual and DigiCash couldn&#039;t survive, so why does Apple&#039;s iTunes think it can make money at 99 cents per download? In Japan, NTT DoCoMo acts as a payment gateway for thousands of merchants. Can MSN, AOL, Amazon.com, or eBay (PayPal) do the same in the US? Could micropayments be the solution for spam?
